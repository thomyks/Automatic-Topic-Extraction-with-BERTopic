1203.055,Afshin Rostamizadeh,"Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh",Algorithms for Learning Kernels Based on Centered Alignment,,Journal of Machine Learning Research 13 (2012) 795-828,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  This paper presents new and effective algorithms for learning kernels. In
particular, as shown by our empirical results, these algorithms consistently
outperform the so-called uniform combination solution that has proven to be
difficult to improve upon in the past, as well as other algorithms for learning
kernels based on convex combinations of base kernels in both classification and
regression. Our algorithms are based on the notion of centered alignment which
is used as a similarity measure between kernels or kernel matrices. We present
a number of novel algorithmic, theoretical, and empirical results for learning
kernels based on our notion of centered alignment. In particular, we describe
efficient algorithms for learning a maximum alignment kernel by showing that
the problem can be reduced to a simple QP and discuss a one-stage algorithm for
learning both a kernel and a hypothesis based on that kernel using an
alignment-based regularization. Our theoretical results include a novel
concentration bound for centered alignment between kernel matrices, the proof
of the existence of effective predictors for kernels with high alignment, both
for classification and for regression, and the proof of stability-based
generalization bounds for a broad family of algorithms for learning kernels
based on centered alignment. We also report the results of experiments with our
centered alignment-based algorithms in both classification and regression.

It is
unique in combining three different spreading strategies: local probing,
neighbourhood probing, and global probing. We propose a mathematical model that
combines three modes of spreading, local, neighbourhood and global to capture
the worm's spreading behaviour. The parameters of the model are inferred
directly from network data obtained during the first day of the Conifcker
epidemic. The model is then used to explore the trade-off between spreading
modes in determining the worm's effectiveness. Our results show that the
Conficker epidemic is an example of a critically hybrid epidemic, in which the
different modes of spreading in isolation do not lead to successful epidemics.
Such hybrid spreading strategies may be used beneficially to provide the most
effective strategies for promulgating information across a large population.
When used maliciously, however, they can present a dangerous challenge to
current internet security protocols.

include the spreading of diseases, information, and computer viruses. Epidemics
can spread by local spreading, where infected nodes can only infect a limited
set of direct target nodes and global spreading, where an infected node can
infect every other node. In reality, many epidemics spread using a hybrid
mixture of both types of spreading. In this study we develop a theoretical
framework for studying hybrid epidemics, and examine the optimum balance
between spreading mechanisms in terms of achieving the maximum outbreak size.
We show the existence of critically hybrid epidemics where neither spreading
mechanism alone can cause a noticeable spread but a combination of the two
spreading mechanisms would produce an enormous outbreak. Our results provide
new strategies for maximising beneficial epidemics and estimating the worst
outcome of damaging hybrid epidemics.

infection following fluid-phase diffusion of virions and by highly-efficient
direct cell-to-cell transmission at immune cell contacts. The contribution of
this hybrid spreading mechanism, which is also a characteristic of some
important computer worm outbreaks, to HIV-1 progression in vivo remains
unknown. Here we present a new mathematical model that explicitly incorporates
the ability of HIV-1 to use hybrid spreading mechanisms and evaluate the
consequences for HIV-1 pathogenenesis. The model captures the major phases of
the HIV-1 infection course of a cohort of treatment naive patients and also
accurately predicts the results of the Short Pulse Anti-Retroviral Therapy at
Seroconversion (SPARTAC) trial. Using this model we find that hybrid spreading
is critical to seed and establish infection, and that cell-to-cell spread and
increased CD4+ T cell activation are important for HIV-1 progression. Notably,
the model predicts that cell-to-cell spread becomes increasingly effective as
infection progresses and thus may present a considerable treatment barrier.
Deriving predictions of various treatments' influence on HIV-1 progression
highlights the importance of earlier intervention and suggests that treatments
effectively targeting cell-to-cell HIV-1 spread can delay progression to AIDS.
This study suggests that hybrid spreading is a fundamental feature of HIV
infection, and provides the mathematical framework incorporating this feature
with which to evaluate future therapeutic strategies.

count data such as text and images. Applications require LDA to handle both
large datasets and a large number of topics. Though distributed CPU systems
have been used, GPU-based systems have emerged as a promising alternative
because of the high computational power and memory bandwidth of GPUs. However,
existing GPU-based LDA systems cannot support a large number of topics because
they use algorithms on dense data structures whose time and space complexity is
linear to the number of topics. In this paper, we propose SaberLDA, a GPU-based
LDA system that implements a sparsity-aware algorithm to achieve sublinear time
complexity and scales well to learn a large number of topics. To address the
challenges introduced by sparsity, we propose a novel data layout, a new
warp-based sampling kernel, and an efficient sparse count matrix updating
algorithm that improves locality, makes efficient utilization of GPU warps, and
reduces memory consumption. Experiments show that SaberLDA can learn from
billions-token-scale data with up to 10,000 topics, which is almost two orders
of magnitude larger than that of the previous GPU-based systems. With a single
GPU card, SaberLDA is able to learn 10,000 topics from a dataset of billions of
tokens in a few hours, which is only achievable with clusters with tens of
machines before.

characterized by homogeneous ignition and a high temperature regime
characterized by self-propagating reactions in the multilayers. In this work,
we extend the analysis to find optimal experimental designs that would provide
the best data for inference. We employ a rigorous framework that quantifies the
expected in- formation gain in an experiment, and find the optimal design
conditions using numerical techniques of Monte Carlo, sparse quadrature, and
polynomial chaos surrogates. For the low temperature regime, we find the
optimal foil heating rate and pulse duration, and confirm through simulation
that the optimal design indeed leads to sharper posterior distributions of the
diffusion parameters. For the high temperature regime, we demonstrate potential
for increase in the expected information gain of the posteriors by increasing
sample size and reducing uncertainty in measurements. Moreover, posterior
marginals are also produced to verify favorable experimental scenarios for this

context of atomic physics. Starting from basic rules of probability, we present
the Bayes' theorem and its applications. In particular we discuss about how to
calculate simple and joint probability distributions and the Bayesian evidence,
a model dependent quantity that allows to assign probabilities to different
hypotheses from the analysis of a same data set. To give some practical
examples, these methods are applied to two concrete cases. In the first
example, the presence or not of a satellite line in an atomic spectrum is
investigated. In the second example, we determine the most probable model among
a set of possible profiles from the analysis of a statistically poor spectrum.
We show also how to calculate the probability distribution of the main spectral
component without having to determine uniquely the spectrum modeling. For these
two studies, we implement the program Nested fit to calculate the different
probability distributions and other related quantities. Nested fit is a
Fortran90/Python code developed during the last years for analysis of atomic
spectra. As indicated by the name, it is based on the nested algorithm, which
is presented in details together with the program itself.

Papalexakis",SamBaTen: Sampling-based Batch Incremental Tensor Decomposition,,,,,stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Tensor decompositions are invaluable tools in analyzing multimodal datasets.
In many real-world scenarios, such datasets are far from being static, to the
contrary they tend to grow over time. For instance, in an online social network
setting, as we observe new interactions over time, our dataset gets updated in
its ""time"" mode. How can we maintain a valid and accurate tensor decomposition
of such a dynamically evolving multimodal dataset, without having to re-compute
the entire decomposition after every single update? In this paper we introduce
SaMbaTen, a Sampling-based Batch Incremental Tensor Decomposition algorithm,
which incrementally maintains the decomposition given new updates to the tensor
dataset. SaMbaTen is able to scale to datasets that the state-of-the-art in
incremental tensor decomposition is unable to operate on, due to its ability to
effectively summarize the existing tensor and the incoming updates, and perform
all computations in the reduced summary space. We extensively evaluate SaMbaTen
using synthetic and real datasets. Indicatively, SaMbaTen achieves comparable
accuracy to state-of-the-art incremental and non-incremental techniques, while
being 25-30 times faster. Furthermore, SaMbaTen scales to very large sparse and
dense dynamically evolving tensors of dimensions up to 100K x 100K x 100K where
state-of-the-art incremental approaches were not able to operate.

the multi-penalty regularization scheme based on Nystr{\""o}m type subsampling
which is motivated from well-studied manifold regularization schemes. We
develop a theoretical analysis of multi-penalty least-square regularization
scheme under the general source condition in vector-valued function setting,
therefore the results can also be applied to multi-task learning problems. We
achieve the optimal minimax convergence rates of multi-penalty regularization
using the concept of effective dimension for the appropriate subsampling size.
We discuss an aggregation approach based on linear function strategy to combine
various Nystr{\""o}m approximants. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of
multi-penalty regularization based on Nystr{\""o}m type subsampling on
Caltech-101 data set for multi-class image classification and NSL-KDD benchmark

We
show how autoregressive linear, i.e., linearly activated recurrent neural
networks (LRNNs) can approximate any time-dependent function f(t). The
approximation can effectively be learned by simply solving a linear equation
system; no backpropagation or similar methods are needed. Furthermore, and this
is the main contribution of this article, the size of an LRNN can be reduced
significantly in one step after inspecting the spectrum of the network
transition matrix, i.e., its eigenvalues, by taking only the most relevant
components. Therefore, in contrast to other approaches, we do not only learn
network weights but also the network architecture. LRNNs have interesting
properties: They end up in ellipse trajectories in the long run and allow the
prediction of further values and compact representations of functions. We
demonstrate this by several experiments, among them multiple superimposed
oscillators (MSO), robotic soccer (RoboCup), and stock price prediction. LRNNs
outperform the previous state-of-the-art for the MSO task with a minimal number
of units.

widely used in many areas of software engineering. Deep learners utilizes
extensive computational power and can take a long time to train-- making it
difficult to widely validate and repeat and improve their results. Further,
they are not the best solution in all domains. For example, recent results show
that for finding related Stack Overflow posts, a tuned SVM performs similarly
to a deep learner, but is significantly faster to train. This paper extends
that recent result by clustering the dataset, then tuning very learners within
each cluster. This approach is over 500 times faster than deep learning (and
over 900 times faster if we use all the cores on a standard laptop computer).
Significantly, this faster approach generates classifiers nearly as good
(within 2\% F1 Score) as the much slower deep learning method. Hence we
recommend this faster methods since it is much easier to reproduce and utilizes
far fewer CPU resources. More generally, we recommend that before researchers
release research results, that they compare their supposedly sophisticated
methods against simpler alternatives (e.g applying simpler learners to build
local models).

Decision Tree, i.e. GBDT whose training process needs considerable

studentâs compactness, without sacrificing too much performance. We study KD
from a new perspective: rather than compressing models, we train students
parameterized identically to their teachers. Surprisingly, these Born-Again
Networks (BANs), outperform their teachers significantly, both on computer
vision and language modeling tasks. Our experiments with BANs based on
DenseNets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 (3.5%) and

agnostic regression setting with the $\ell_p$ loss, where $p\in [1,\infty]$. We
construct a generic approximate sample compression scheme for real-valued
function classes exhibiting exponential size in the fat-shattering dimension
but independent of the sample size. Notably, for linear regression, an
approximate compression of size linear in the dimension is constructed.
Moreover, for $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ losses, we can even exhibit an
efficient exact sample compression scheme of size linear in the dimension. We
further show that for every other $\ell_p$ loss, $p\in (1,\infty)$, there does
not exist an exact agnostic compression scheme of bounded size. This refines
and generalizes a negative result of David, Moran, and Yehudayoff for the
$\ell_2$ loss. We close by posing general open questions: for agnostic
regression with $\ell_1$ loss, does every function class admits an exact
compression scheme of size equal to its pseudo-dimension? For the $\ell_2$
loss, does every function class admit an approximate compression scheme of
polynomial size in the fat-shattering dimension? These questions generalize
Warmuth's classic sample compression conjecture for realizable-case
classification.

prevention, the anomaly detector must be configurable by the human analyst to
minimize the effort on false positives. One important way to configure the
detector is by providing true labels (nominal or anomaly) for a few instances.
Recent work on active anomaly discovery has shown that greedily querying the
top-scoring instance and tuning the weights of ensemble detectors based on
label feedback allows us to quickly discover true anomalies.
  This paper makes four main contributions to improve the state-of-the-art in
anomaly discovery using tree-based ensembles. First, we provide an important
insight that explains the practical successes of unsupervised tree-based
ensembles and active learning based on greedy query selection strategy. We also
present empirical results on real-world data to support our insights and
theoretical analysis to support active learning. Second, we develop a novel
batch active learning algorithm to improve the diversity of discovered
anomalies based on a formalism called compact description to describe the
discovered anomalies. Third, we develop a novel active learning algorithm to
handle streaming data setting. We present a data drift detection algorithm that
not only detects the drift robustly, but also allows us to take corrective
actions to adapt the anomaly detector in a principled manner. Fourth, we
present extensive experiments to evaluate our insights and our tree-based
active anomaly discovery algorithms in both batch and streaming data settings.
Our results show that active learning allows us to discover significantly more
anomalies than state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines, our batch active
learning algorithm discovers diverse anomalies, and our algorithms under the
streaming-data setup are competitive with the batch setup.

optimization to find minima of functions. Many implementations of gradient
descent rely on discretized versions, i.e., moving in the gradient direction
for a set step size, recomputing the gradient, and continuing. In this paper,
we present an approach to manifold learning where gradient descent takes place
in the infinite dimensional space $\mathcal{E} = {\rm Emb}(M,\mathbb{R}^N)$ of
smooth embeddings $\phi$ of a manifold $M$ into $\mathbb{R}^N$. Implementing a
discretized version of gradient descent for $P:\mathcal{E}\to {\mathbb R}$, a
penalty function that scores an embedding $\phi \in \mathcal{E}$, requires
estimating how far we can move in a fixed direction -- the direction of one
gradient step -- before leaving the space of smooth embeddings. Our main result
is to give an explicit lower bound for this step length in terms of the
Riemannian geometry of $\phi(M)$. In particular, we consider the case when the
gradient of $P$ is pointwise normal to the embedded manifold $\phi(M)$. We
prove this case arises when $P$ is invariant under diffeomorphisms of $M$, a
natural condition in manifold learning.

analysis challenging. An abundant literature addresses missing values in an
inferential framework: estimating parameters and their variance from incomplete
tables. Here, we consider supervised-learning settings: predicting a target
when missing values appear in both training and testing data. We show the
consistency of two approaches in prediction. A striking result is that the
widely-used method of imputing with a constant, such as the mean prior to
learning is consistent when missing values are not informative. This contrasts
with inferential settings where mean imputation is pointed at for distorting
the distribution of the data. That such a simple approach can be consistent is
important in practice. We also show that a predictor suited for complete
observations can predict optimally on incomplete data, through multiple
imputation. Finally, to compare imputation with learning directly with a model
that accounts for missing values, we analyze further decision trees. These can
naturally tackle empirical risk minimization with missing values, due to their
ability to handle the half-discrete nature of incomplete variables. After
comparing theoretically and empirically different missing values strategies in

time required in the training process. Such a training process consists of an
iterative change of parameters trying to minimize a loss function. These
changes are driven by a dataset, which can be seen as a set of labelled points
in an n-dimensional space. In this paper, we explore the concept of are
representative dataset which is a dataset smaller than the original one,
satisfying a nearness condition independent of isometric transformations.
Representativeness is measured using persistence diagrams (a computational
topology tool) due to its computational efficiency. We prove that the accuracy
of the learning process of a neural network on a representative dataset is
""similar"" to the accuracy on the original dataset when the neural network
architecture is a perceptron and the loss function is the mean squared error.
These theoretical results accompanied by experimentation open a door to
reducing the size of the dataset to gain time in the training process of any
neural network.

between the physical and conceptual entities of a brain-like model. Features
and concept instances are put into context, where the paper suggests that
features may be the electrical wiring, although chemical connections are also
possible. With this idea, the actual length of the connection is important,
because it is related to firing rates and neuron synchronization, but the
signal type is less important. The paper then suggests that concepts are neuron
groups that link feature sets and concept instances are determined by chemical
signals from those groups. Therefore, features become the static horizontal
framework of the neural system and concepts are vertically interconnected
combinations of these. With regards to functionality, the neuron is then
considered to be functional and the more horizontal memory structures can be
glial. This would also suggest that features can be distributed entities and
not concentrated to a single area.

discounted Markov Reward Processes (MRP) with nonlinear functions trained with
the Temporal-Difference (TD) learning algorithm. We first consider this problem
under a certain scaling of the approximating function, leading to a regime
called lazy training. In this regime, the parameters of the model vary only
slightly during the learning process, a feature that has recently been observed
in the training of neural networks, where the scaling we study arises
naturally, implicit in the initialization of their parameters. Both in the
under- and over-parametrized frameworks, we prove exponential convergence to
local, respectively global minimizers of the above algorithm in the lazy
training regime. We then compare this scaling of the parameters to the
mean-field regime, where the approximately linear behavior of the model is
lost. Under this alternative scaling we prove that all fixed points of the
dynamics in parameter space are global minimizers. We finally give examples of
our convergence results in the case of models that diverge if trained with
non-lazy TD learning, and in the case of neural networks.

serious impacts on people's lives, ranging from authentication to surveillance
tracking. It is therefore critical to develop techniques that can reveal
unintended biases in facial classifiers to help guide the ethical use of facial
analysis technology. This work proposes a framework called \textit{image
counterfactual sensitivity analysis}, which we explore as a proof-of-concept in
analyzing a smiling attribute classifier trained on faces of celebrities. The
framework utilizes counterfactuals to examine how a classifier's prediction
changes if a face characteristic slightly changes. We leverage recent advances
in generative adversarial networks to build a realistic generative model of
face images that affords controlled manipulation of specific image
characteristics. We then introduce a set of metrics that measure the effect of
manipulating a specific property on the output of the trained classifier.
Empirically, we find several different factors of variation that affect the
predictions of the smiling classifier. This proof-of-concept demonstrates
potential ways generative models can be leveraged for fine-grained analysis of
bias and fairness.

  https://aiforsocialgood.github.io/icml2019/index.htm",,,,cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a hospital department where machine learning
has the potential to provide valuable assistance in clinical decision making.
Classical machine learning models usually only provide point-estimates and no
uncertainty of predictions. In practice, uncertain predictions should be
presented to doctors with extra care in order to prevent potentially
catastrophic treatment decisions. In this work we show how Bayesian modelling
and the predictive uncertainty that it provides can be used to mitigate risk of
misguided prediction and to detect out-of-domain examples in a medical setting.
We derive analytically a bound on the prediction loss with respect to
predictive uncertainty. The bound shows that uncertainty can mitigate loss.
Furthermore, we apply a Bayesian Neural Network to the MIMIC-III dataset,
predicting risk of mortality of ICU patients. Our empirical results show that
uncertainty can indeed prevent potential errors and reliably identifies
out-of-domain patients. These results suggest that Bayesian predictive
uncertainty can greatly improve trustworthiness of machine learning models in
high-risk settings such as the ICU.

  systems across scales",,,,,physics.bio-ph physics.data-an,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Self-propelling organisms locomote via generation of patterns of
self-deformation. Despite the diversity of body plans, internal actuation
schemes and environments in limbless vertebrates and invertebrates, such
organisms often use similar travelling waves of axial body bending for
movement. Delineating how parameters (wave amplitudes, frequencies) lead to
locomotor performance (e.g. speed, energy, turning capabilities) remains
challenging. Here we show that a geometric framework that replaces laborious
calculation with a diagrammatic scheme is well suited to discovery and
comparison of optimal patterns of wave dynamics in diverse living systems. We
focus on a regime of undulatory locomotion, that of highly damped environments,
which is applicable not only to small organism movement in viscous fluids, but
also larger animals moving in frictional fluids (sand) and on frictional
ground. We find that the travelling wave dynamics used by mm-scale nematode
worms and cm-scale desert dwelling snakes and lizards can be described by time
series of the weights associated with two principal modes. The approximately
circular closed path trajectories of mode weights in a self-deformation space
enclose near-maximal surface integral (geometric phase) for organisms spanning
two decades in body length. We hypothesize that such trajectories are targets
of control (which we refer to as ``serpenoid templates""). Further, the
geometric approach reveals how seemingly complex behaviors such as turning in
worms and sidewinding snakes can be described as modulations of templates.
Thus, the use of differential geometry in living systems can assist in the
growth of comparative neuromechanics, allowing a common description of
locomotion across taxa and providing hypotheses for function at lower levels of
organization.

problems with methods from Machine Learning, applied to the single source,
capacitated, facility location problem. Our study is framed in the context
where a reference facility location optimization problem is given. Assuming
there exist data for many variations of the reference problem (historical or
simulated) along with their optimal solution, we study how one can exploit
these to make predictions about an unseen new instance. We demonstrate how a
classifier can be built from these data to determine whether the solution to
the reference problem still applies to a new instance. In case the reference
solution is partially applicable, we build a regressor indicating the magnitude
of the expected change, and conversely how much of it can be kept for the new
instance. This insight, derived from a priori information, is expressed via an
additional constraint in the original mathematical programming formulation. We
present an empirical evaluation and discuss the benefits, drawbacks and
perspectives of such an approach. Although presented through the application to
the facility location problem, the approach developed here is general and
explores a new perspective on the exploitation of past experience in
combinatorial optimization.

detection method called DA3D. Here, we use adversarial autoencoders to generate
anomalous counterexamples based on the normal data only. These artificial
anomalies used during training allow the detection of real, yet unseen
anomalies. With our novel generative approach, we transform the unsupervised
task of anomaly detection to a supervised one, which is more tractable by
machine learning and especially deep learning methods. DA3D surpasses the

  Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems",,10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2984514,,cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Previous literature on unsupervised learning focused on designing structural
priors with the aim of learning meaningful features. However, this was done
without considering the description length of the learned representations which
is a direct and unbiased measure of the model complexity. In this paper, first
we introduce the $\varphi$ metric that evaluates unsupervised models based on
their reconstruction accuracy and the degree of compression of their internal
representations. We then present and define two activation functions (Identity,
ReLU) as base of reference and three sparse activation functions (top-k
absolutes, Extrema-Pool indices, Extrema) as candidate structures that minimize
the previously defined $\varphi$. We lastly present Sparsely Activated Networks
(SANs) that consist of kernels with shared weights that, during encoding, are
convolved with the input and then passed through a sparse activation function.
During decoding, the same weights are convolved with the sparse activation map
and subsequently the partial reconstructions from each weight are summed to
reconstruct the input. We compare SANs using the five previously defined
activation functions on a variety of datasets (Physionet, UCI-epilepsy, MNIST,
FMNIST) and show that models that are selected using $\varphi$ have small
description representation length and consist of interpretable kernels.

of physics and engineering domains for its ability to solve decision-making
problems that were previously out of reach due to a combination of
non-linearity and high dimensionality. In the last few years, it has spread in
the field of computational mechanics, and particularly in fluid dynamics, with
recent applications in flow control and shape optimization. In this work, we
conduct a detailed review of existing DRL applications to fluid mechanics
problems. In addition, we present recent results that further illustrate the
potential of DRL in Fluid Mechanics. The coupling methods used in each case are
covered, detailing their advantages and limitations. Our review also focuses on
the comparison with classical methods for optimal control and optimization.
Finally, several test cases are described that illustrate recent progress made
in this field. The goal of this publication is to provide an understanding of
DRL capabilities along with state-of-the-art applications in fluid dynamics to
researchers wishing to address new problems with these methods.

problem. To estimate the mutual information from data, a common practice is
preparing a set of paired samples $\{(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{y}_i)\}_{i=1}^n
\stackrel{\mathrm{i.i.d.}}{\sim} p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$. However, in many
situations, it is difficult to obtain a large number of data pairs. To address
this problem, we propose the semi-supervised Squared-loss Mutual Information
(SMI) estimation method using a small number of paired samples and the
available unpaired ones. We first represent SMI through the density ratio
function, where the expectation is approximated by the samples from marginals
and its assignment parameters. The objective is formulated using the optimal
transport problem and quadratic programming. Then, we introduce the
Least-Squares Mutual Information with Sinkhorn (LSMI-Sinkhorn) algorithm for
efficient optimization. Through experiments, we first demonstrate that the
proposed method can estimate the SMI without a large number of paired samples.
Then, we show the effectiveness of the proposed LSMI-Sinkhorn algorithm on
various types of machine learning problems such as image matching and photo
album summarization. Code can be found at

  Sharifi-Malvajerdi, Moshe Shenfeld",A New Analysis of Differential Privacy's Generalization Guarantees,,,,,cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We give a new proof of the ""transfer theorem"" underlying adaptive data
analysis: that any mechanism for answering adaptively chosen statistical
queries that is differentially private and sample-accurate is also accurate
out-of-sample. Our new proof is elementary and gives structural insights that
we expect will be useful elsewhere. We show: 1) that differential privacy
ensures that the expectation of any query on the posterior distribution on
datasets induced by the transcript of the interaction is close to its true
value on the data distribution, and 2) sample accuracy on its own ensures that
any query answer produced by the mechanism is close to its posterior
expectation with high probability. This second claim follows from a thought
experiment in which we imagine that the dataset is resampled from the posterior
distribution after the mechanism has committed to its answers. The transfer
theorem then follows by summing these two bounds, and in particular, avoids the
""monitor argument"" used to derive high probability bounds in prior work. An
upshot of our new proof technique is that the concrete bounds we obtain are
substantially better than the best previously known bounds, even though the
improvements are in the constants, rather than the asymptotics (which are known
to be tight). As we show, our new bounds outperform the naive
""sample-splitting"" baseline at dramatically smaller dataset sizes compared to
the previous state of the art, bringing techniques from this literature closer
to practicality.

the brain. Specifically, we introduce a model for hierarchically structured
concepts and we show how a biologically plausible neural network can recognize
these concepts, and how it can learn them in the first place. Our main goal is
to introduce a general framework for these tasks and prove formally how both
(recognition and learning) can be achieved.
  We show that both tasks can be accomplished even in presence of noise. For
learning, we analyze Oja's rule formally, a well-known biologically-plausible
rule for adjusting the weights of synapses. We complement the learning results
with lower bounds asserting that, in order to recognize concepts of a certain
hierarchical depth, neural networks must have a corresponding number of layers.

recently attracts a great deal of attention in the studies of protein structure

regularization parameters to correctly infer interactions in Boltzmann machine
learning. Using $L_2$ regularization for fields, group $L_1$ for couplings is
shown to be very effective for sparse couplings in comparison with $L_2$ and
$L_1$. Two regularization parameters are tuned to yield equal values for both
the sample and ensemble averages of evolutionary energy. Both averages smoothly
change and converge, but their learning profiles are very different between
learning methods. The Adam method is modified to make stepsize proportional to
the gradient for sparse couplings. It is shown by first inferring interactions
from protein sequences and then from Monte Carlo samples that the fields and
couplings can be well recovered, but that recovering the pairwise correlations
in the resolution of a total energy is harder for the natural proteins than for
the protein-like sequences. Selective temperature for folding/structural
constrains in protein evolution is also estimated.

1909.10228,Zhigang Yao,Zhigang Yao and Yuqing Xia,Manifold Fitting under Unbounded Noise,,,,,stat.ML cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  There has been an emerging trend in non-Euclidean statistical analysis of
aiming to recover a low dimensional structure, namely a manifold, underlying
the high dimensional data. Recovering the manifold requires the noise to be of
certain concentration. Existing methods address this problem by constructing an
approximated manifold based on the tangent space estimation at each sample
point. Although theoretical convergence for these methods is guaranteed, either
the samples are noiseless or the noise is bounded. However, if the noise is
unbounded, which is a common scenario, the tangent space estimation at the
noisy samples will be blurred. Fitting a manifold from the blurred tangent
space might increase the inaccuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new
manifold-fitting method, by which the output manifold is constructed by
directly estimating the tangent spaces at the projected points on the
underlying manifold, rather than at the sample points, to decrease the error
caused by the noise. Assuming the noise is unbounded, our new method provides
theoretical convergence in high probability, in terms of the upper bound of the
distance between the estimated and underlying manifold. The smoothness of the
estimated manifold is also evaluated by bounding the supremum of twice
difference above. Numerical simulations are provided to validate our
theoretical findings and demonstrate the advantages of our method over other
relevant manifold fitting methods. Finally, our method is applied to real data
examples.

prenatal US, dozens of standard planes are manually acquired with a 2D probe.
It is time-consuming and operator-dependent. In comparison, 3D US containing
multiple standard planes in one shot has the inherent advantages of less
user-dependency and more efficiency. However, manual plane localization in US
volume is challenging due to the huge search space and large fetal posture
variation. In this study, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to automatically localize fetal brain standard planes in 3D US. Our
contribution is two-fold. First, we equip the RL framework with a
landmark-aware alignment module to provide warm start and strong spatial bounds
for the agent actions, thus ensuring its effectiveness. Second, instead of
passively and empirically terminating the agent inference, we propose a
recurrent neural network based strategy for active termination of the agent's
interaction procedure. This improves both the accuracy and efficiency of the
localization system. Extensively validated on our in-house large dataset, our
approach achieves the accuracy of 3.4mm/9.6{\deg} and 2.7mm/9.1{\deg} for the
transcerebellar and transthalamic plane localization, respectively. Ourproposed
RL framework is general and has the potential to improve the efficiency and
standardization of US scanning.

epidemiological surveys and evolutionary studies. Statistical learning methods
are widely used to classify and identify viral sequences in samples from
environments. These methods face several challenges associated with the nature
and properties of viral genomes such as recombination, mutation rate and
diversity. Also, new generations of sequencing technologies rise other
difficulties by generating massive amounts of fragmented sequences. While
linear classifiers are often used to classify viruses, there is a lack of
exploration of the accuracy space of existing models in the context of
alignment free approaches. In this study, we present an exhaustive assessment
procedure exploring the power of linear classifiers in genotyping and subtyping
partial and complete genomes. It is applied to the Hepatitis C viruses (HCV).
Several variables are considered in this investigation such as classifier types
(generative and discriminative) and their hyper-parameters (smoothing value and
regularization penalty function), the classification task (genotyping and
subtyping), the length of the tested sequences (partial and complete) and the
length of k-mer words. Overall, several classifiers perform well given a set of
precise combination of the experimental variables mentioned above. Finally, we
provide the procedure and benchmark data to allow for more robust assessment of
classification from virus genomes.

as a sum of two independent processes: one spanned by a finite basis of
inducing points and the other capturing the remaining variation. We show that
this formulation recovers existing approximations and at the same time allows
to obtain tighter lower bounds on the marginal likelihood and new stochastic
variational inference algorithms. We demonstrate the efficiency of these
algorithms in several Gaussian process models ranging from standard regression
to multi-class classification using (deep) convolutional Gaussian processes and
report state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 among purely GP-based models.

we propose filtering the auto-labeled data using a trained model that predicts

proposed auto-annotation filtering over training on data contaminated with
inaccurate labels.
  Moreover, our experimental results show that in the case of semantic
segmentation, the performance of a state-of-the-art model can be achieved by
training it with only a fraction (30$\%$) of the original manually labeled data
set, and replacing the rest with the auto-annotated, quality filtered labels.

Networks (DNNs) to process sensor data and return inference results to humans.
Effective deployment of DNNs in these interactive scenarios requires meeting
latency and accuracy constraints while minimizing energy, a problem exacerbated
by common system dynamics. Prior approaches handle dynamics through either (1)
system-oblivious DNN adaptation, which adjusts DNN latency/accuracy tradeoffs,
or (2) application-oblivious system adaptation, which adjusts resources to
change latency/energy tradeoffs. In contrast, this paper improves on the
state-of-the-art by coordinating application- and system-level adaptation.
ALERT, our runtime scheduler, uses a probabilistic model to detect
environmental volatility and then simultaneously select both a DNN and a system
resource configuration to meet latency, accuracy, and energy constraints. We
evaluate ALERT on CPU and GPU platforms for image and speech tasks in dynamic
environments. ALERT's holistic approach achieves more than 13% energy
reduction, and 27% error reduction over prior approaches that adapt solely at
the application or system level. Furthermore, ALERT incurs only 3% more energy
consumption and 2% higher DNN-inference error than an oracle scheme with
perfect application and system knowledge.

includes the cost of features in the optimization criteria. Individually for
each sample, its features are sequentially acquired to maximize accuracy while
minimizing the acquired features' cost. However, existing approaches can only
process data that can be expressed as vectors of fixed length. In real life,
the data often possesses rich and complex structure, which can be more
precisely described with formats such as XML or JSON. The data is hierarchical
and often contains nested lists of objects. In this work, we extend an existing
deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm with hierarchical deep sets and
hierarchical softmax, so that it can directly process this data. The extended
method has greater control over which features it can acquire and, in
experiments with seven datasets, we show that this leads to superior
performance. To showcase the real usage of the new method, we apply it to a

  Network Calculus",,,10.1109/ISCC50000.2020.9219693,,cs.NI cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The network calculus (NC) analysis takes a simple model consisting of a
network of schedulers and data flows crossing them. A number of analysis
""building blocks"" can then be applied to capture the model without imposing
pessimistic assumptions like self-contention on tandems of servers. Yet, adding
pessimism cannot always be avoided. To compute the best bound on a single
flow's end-to-end delay thus boils down to finding the least pessimistic
contention models for all tandems of schedulers in the network - and an
exhaustive search can easily become a very resource intensive task. The
literature proposes a promising solution to this dilemma: a heuristic making
use of machine learning (ML) predictions inside the NC analysis.
  While results of this work were promising in terms of delay bound quality and
computational effort, there is little to no insight on when a prediction is
made or if the trained algorithm can achieve similarly striking results in
networks vastly differing from its training data. In this paper, we address
these pending questions. We evaluate the influence of the training data and its
features on accuracy, impact and scalability. Additionally, we contribute an
extension of the method by predicting the best $n$ contention model
alternatives in order to achieve increased robustness for its application
outside the training data. Our numerical evaluation shows that good accuracy
can still be achieved on large networks although we restrict the training to
networks that are two orders of magnitude smaller.

random forests into neural networks. Existing methods propose a direct mapping
and produce very inefficient architectures. In this work, we introduce an
imitation learning approach by generating training data from a random forest
and learning a neural network that imitates its behavior. This implicit
transformation creates very efficient neural networks that learn the decision
boundaries of a random forest. The generated model is differentiable, can be
used as a warm start for fine-tuning, and enables end-to-end optimization.
Experiments on several real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate superior
performance, especially when training with very few training examples. Compared
to state-of-the-art methods, we significantly reduce the number of network
parameters while achieving the same or even improved accuracy due to better
generalization.

evaluating an individual who presents with seizures. It determines the course
of clinical diagnosis and treatment, and its impact stretches beyond the
clinical domain to epilepsy research and the development of novel therapies.
Automated identification of seizure type may facilitate understanding of the
disease, and seizure detection and prediction has been the focus of recent
research that has sought to exploit the benefits of machine learning and deep
learning architectures. Nevertheless, there is not yet a definitive solution
for automating the classification of seizure type, a task that must currently
be performed by an expert epileptologist. Inspired by recent advances in neural
memory networks (NMNs), we introduce a novel approach for the classification of
seizure type using electrophysiological data. We first explore the performance
of traditional deep learning techniques which use convolutional and recurrent
neural networks, and enhance these architectures by using external memory
modules with trainable neural plasticity. We show that our model achieves a
state-of-the-art weighted F1 score of 0.945 for seizure type classification on
the TUH EEG Seizure Corpus with the IBM TUSZ preprocessed data. This work
highlights the potential of neural memory networks to support the field of
epilepsy research, along with biomedical research and signal analysis more
broadly.

have achieved the state of the art performance since the first inauguration,
known as the lower-upper-bound estimation (LUBE) method. However,
currently-available cost functions for uncertainty guided NN training are not
always converging and all converged NNs are not generating optimized prediction
intervals (PIs). Moreover, several groups have proposed different quality
criteria for PIs. These raise a question about their relative effectiveness.
Most of the existing cost functions of uncertainty guided NN training are not
customizable and the convergence of training is uncertain. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a highly customizable smooth cost function for developing NNs
to construct optimal PIs. The optimized average width of PIs, PI-failure
distances and the PI coverage probability (PICP) are computed for the test
dataset. The performance of the proposed method is examined for the wind power
generation and the electricity demand data. Results show that the proposed
method reduces variation in the quality of PIs, accelerates the training, and
improves convergence probability from 99.2% to 99.8%.

  accuracy-stability trade-off in inverse problems",,,,,cs.LG cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Methods inspired by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are starting to
fundamentally change computational science and engineering through breakthrough
performances on challenging problems. However, reliability and trustworthiness
of such techniques is a major concern. In inverse problems in imaging, the
focus of this paper, there is increasing empirical evidence that methods may
suffer from hallucinations, i.e., false, but realistic-looking artifacts;
instability, i.e., sensitivity to perturbations in the data; and unpredictable
generalization, i.e., excellent performance on some images, but significant
deterioration on others. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for these
phenomena. We give mathematical explanations for how and when such effects
arise in arbitrary reconstruction methods, with several of our results taking
the form of `no free lunch' theorems. Specifically, we show that (i) methods
that overperform on a single image can wrongly transfer details from one image
to another, creating a hallucination, (ii) methods that overperform on two or
more images can hallucinate or be unstable, (iii) optimizing the
accuracy-stability trade-off is generally difficult, (iv) hallucinations and
instabilities, if they occur, are not rare events, and may be encouraged by
standard training, (v) it may be impossible to construct optimal reconstruction
maps for certain problems. Our results trace these effects to the kernel of the
forward operator whenever it is nontrivial, but also apply to the case when the
forward operator is ill-conditioned. Based on these insights, our work aims to
spur research into new ways to develop robust and reliable AI-based methods for
inverse problems in imaging.

materials physics, developmental biology and ecology, among many others. The
physics underlying the patterns is specific to the mechanisms, and is encoded
by partial differential equations (PDEs). With the aim of discovering hidden
physics, we have previously presented a variational approach to identifying
such systems of PDEs in the face of noisy data at varying fidelities (Computer
Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 353:201-216, 2019). Here, we
extend our variational system identification methods to address the challenges
presented by image data on microstructures in materials physics. PDEs are
formally posed as initial and boundary value problems over combinations of time
intervals and spatial domains whose evolution is either fixed or can be
tracked. However, the vast majority of microscopy techniques for evolving
microstructure in a given material system deliver micrographs of pattern
evolution over domains that bear no relation with each other at different time
instants. The temporal resolution can rarely capture the fastest time scales
that dominate the early dynamics, and noise abounds. Furthermore, data for
evolution of the same phenomenon in a material system may well be obtained from
different physical specimens. Against this backdrop of spatially unrelated,
sparse and multi-source data, we exploit the variational framework to make
judicious choices of weighting functions and identify PDE operators from the
dynamics. A consistency condition arises for parsimonious inference of a
minimal set of the spatial operators at steady state. It is complemented by a
confirmation test that provides a sharp condition for acceptance of the
inferred operators. The entire framework is demonstrated on synthetic data that
reflect the characteristics of the experimental material microscopy images.

  added",,,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  This note discusses a simple modification of cross-conformal prediction
inspired by recent work on e-values. The precursor of conformal prediction
developed in the 1990s by Gammerman, Vapnik, and Vovk was also based on
e-values and is called conformal e-prediction in this note. Replacing e-values
by p-values led to conformal prediction, which has important advantages over
conformal e-prediction without obvious disadvantages. The situation with
cross-conformal prediction is, however, different: whereas for cross-conformal
prediction validity is only an empirical fact (and can be broken with excessive
randomization), this note draws the reader's attention to the obvious fact that
cross-conformal e-prediction enjoys a guaranteed property of validity.

of combining weak and moderately inaccurate hypotheses to a strong and accurate
one. We study boosting under the assumption that the weak hypotheses belong to
a class of bounded capacity. This assumption is inspired by the common
convention that weak hypotheses are ""rules-of-thumbs"" from an ""easy-to-learn
class"". (Schapire and Freund~'12, Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David '14.) Formally,
we assume the class of weak hypotheses has a bounded VC dimension. We focus on
two main questions: (i) Oracle Complexity: How many weak hypotheses are needed
to produce an accurate hypothesis? We design a novel boosting algorithm and
demonstrate that it circumvents a classical lower bound by Freund and Schapire
('95, '12). Whereas the lower bound shows that $\Omega({1}/{\gamma^2})$ weak
hypotheses with $\gamma$-margin are sometimes necessary, our new method
requires only $\tilde{O}({1}/{\gamma})$ weak hypothesis, provided that they
belong to a class of bounded VC dimension. Unlike previous boosting algorithms
which aggregate the weak hypotheses by majority votes, the new boosting
algorithm uses more complex (""deeper"") aggregation rules. We complement this
result by showing that complex aggregation rules are in fact necessary to
circumvent the aforementioned lower bound. (ii) Expressivity: Which tasks can
be learned by boosting weak hypotheses from a bounded VC class? Can complex
concepts that are ""far away"" from the class be learned? Towards answering the
first question we {introduce combinatorial-geometric parameters which capture
expressivity in boosting.} As a corollary we provide an affirmative answer to
the second question for well-studied classes, including half-spaces and
decision stumps. Along the way, we establish and exploit connections with
Discrepancy Theory.

probabilistic model, modulated by an ad hoc regularization term that penalizes
some values of the parameters. Regularization terms appear naturally in
Variational Inference, a tractable way to approximate Bayesian posteriors: the
loss to optimize contains a Kullback--Leibler divergence term between the
approximate posterior and a Bayesian prior. We fully characterize the
regularizers that can arise according to this procedure, and provide a
systematic way to compute the prior corresponding to a given penalty. Such a
characterization can be used to discover constraints over the penalty function,
so that the overall procedure remains Bayesian.

  regularization and controlled McKean-Vlasov dynamics",30 pages; note the change of title,,,,cs.LG math.OC math.PR stat.ML,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We consider the problem of function approximation by two-layer neural nets
with random weights that are ""nearly Gaussian"" in the sense of Kullback-Leibler
divergence. Our setting is the mean-field limit, where the finite population of
neurons in the hidden layer is replaced by a continuous ensemble. We show that
the problem can be phrased as global minimization of a free energy functional
on the space of (finite-length) paths over probability measures on the weights.
This functional trades off the $L^2$ approximation risk of the terminal measure
against the KL divergence of the path with respect to an isotropic Brownian
motion prior. We characterize the unique global minimizer and examine the
dynamics in the space of probability measures over weights that can achieve it.
In particular, we show that the optimal path-space measure corresponds to the
F\""ollmer drift, the solution to a McKean-Vlasov optimal control problem
closely related to the classic Schr\""odinger bridge problem. While the
F\""ollmer drift cannot in general be obtained in closed form, thus limiting its
potential algorithmic utility, we illustrate the viability of the mean-field
Langevin diffusion as a finite-time approximation under various conditions on
entropic regularization. Specifically, we show that it closely tracks the
F\""ollmer drift when the regularization is such that the minimizing density is
log-concave.

planning and optimization problems by satisfying a set of constraints. These
constraint problems (CPs) are typically NP-complete and can be formalized as
constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) or constraint optimization problems
(COPs). Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are good solvers for optimization
problems ubiquitous in various problem domains, however traditional operators
for EAs are 'blind' to constraints or generally use problem dependent objective
functions; as they do not exploit information from the constraints in search
for solutions. A variation of EA, Intelligent constraint handling evolutionary
algorithm (ICHEA), has been demonstrated to be a versatile constraints-guided
EA for continuous constrained problems in our earlier works in (Sharma and
Sharma, 2012) where it extracts information from constraints and exploits it in
the evolutionary search to make the search more efficient. In this paper ICHEA
has been demonstrated to solve benchmark exam timetabling problems, a classic
COP. The presented approach demonstrates competitive results with other
state-of-the-art approaches in EAs in terms of quality of solutions. ICHEA
first uses its inter-marriage crossover operator to satisfy all the given
constraints incrementally and then uses combination of traditional and enhanced
operators to optimize the solution. Generally CPs solved by EAs are problem
dependent penalty based fitness functions. We also proposed a generic
preference based solution model that does not require a problem dependent
fitness function, however currently it only works for mutually exclusive
constraints.

processes to solve complex problems, have gained popularity in recent
literature. The proliferation of proposals prove the growing interest in this
field. The increase in nature- and bio-inspired algorithms, applications, and
guidelines highlights growing interest in this field. However, the exponential
rise in the number of bio-inspired algorithms poses a challenge to the future
trajectory of this research domain. Along the five versions of this document,
the number of approaches grows incessantly, and where having a new biological
description takes precedence over real problem-solving. This document presents
two comprehensive taxonomies. One based on principles of biological similarity,
and the other one based on operational aspects associated with the iteration of
population models that initially have a biological inspiration. Therefore,
these taxonomies enable researchers to categorize existing algorithmic
developments into well-defined classes, considering two criteria: the source of
inspiration, and the behavior exhibited by each algorithm. Using these
taxonomies, we classify 518 algorithms based on nature-inspired and
bio-inspired principles. Each algorithm within these categories is thoroughly
examined, allowing for a critical synthesis of design trends and similarities,
and identifying the most analogous classical algorithm for each proposal. From
our analysis, we conclude that a poor relationship is often found between the
natural inspiration of an algorithm and its behavior. Furthermore, similarities
in terms of behavior between different algorithms are greater than what is
claimed in their public disclosure: specifically, we show that more than
one-fourth of the reviewed solvers are versions of classical algorithms. The
conclusions from the analysis of the algorithms lead to several learned
lessons.

constructing unbiased gradient estimators for such problems is challenging due
to the composition structure. As an alternative, we propose a biased stochastic
gradient descent (BSGD) algorithm and study the bias-variance tradeoff under
different structural assumptions. We establish the sample complexities of BSGD
for strongly convex, convex, and weakly convex objectives under smooth and
non-smooth conditions. Our lower bound analysis shows that the sample
complexities of BSGD cannot be improved for general convex objectives and
nonconvex objectives except for smooth nonconvex objectives with Lipschitz
continuous gradient estimator. For this special setting, we propose an
accelerated algorithm called biased SpiderBoost (BSpiderBoost) that matches the
lower bound complexity. We further conduct numerical experiments on invariant
logistic regression and model-agnostic meta-learning to illustrate the
performance of BSGD and BSpiderBoost.

  networks",,,,,stat.ML cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Estimating the parameters of mathematical models is a common problem in
almost all branches of science. However, this problem can prove notably
difficult when processes and model descriptions become increasingly complex and
an explicit likelihood function is not available. With this work, we propose a
novel method for globally amortized Bayesian inference based on invertible
neural networks which we call BayesFlow. The method uses simulation to learn a
global estimator for the probabilistic mapping from observed data to underlying
model parameters. A neural network pre-trained in this way can then, without
additional training or optimization, infer full posteriors on arbitrary many
real datasets involving the same model family. In addition, our method
incorporates a summary network trained to embed the observed data into
maximally informative summary statistics. Learning summary statistics from data
makes the method applicable to modeling scenarios where standard inference
techniques with hand-crafted summary statistics fail. We demonstrate the
utility of BayesFlow on challenging intractable models from population
dynamics, epidemiology, cognitive science and ecology. We argue that BayesFlow
provides a general framework for building amortized Bayesian parameter
estimation machines for any forward model from which data can be simulated.

space for signal processing, allowing for unique signal flows that are
distinguished from those in regular systems. However, this large degree of
freedom has hindered the deterministic design of disordered systems for target
functionalities. Here, we employ a machine learning (ML) approach for
predicting and designing wave-matter interactions in disordered structures,
thereby identifying scale-free properties for waves. To abstract and map the
features of wave behaviours and disordered structures, we develop
disorder-to-localization and localization-to-disorder convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Each CNN enables the instantaneous prediction of wave
localization in disordered structures and the instantaneous generation of
disordered structures from given localizations. We demonstrate that
CNN-generated disordered structures have scale-free properties with heavy tails
and hub atoms, which exhibit an increase of multiple orders of magnitude in
robustness to accidental defects, such as material or structural imperfection.
Our results verify the critical role of ML network structures in determining
ML-generated real-space structures, which can be used in the design of
defect-immune and efficiently tunable devices.

make data-driven designs. This approach was previously considered by the same
authors of this work in Garatti and Campi (2019), a study that revealed a
deep-seated connection between two concepts: risk (probability of not
satisfying a new, out-of-sample, constraint) and complexity (according to a
definition introduced in paper Garatti and Campi (2019)). This connection was
shown to have profound implications in applications because it implied that the
risk can be estimated from the complexity, a quantity that can be measured from
the data without any knowledge of the data-generation mechanism. In the present
work we establish new results. First, we expand the scope of Garatti and Campi
(2019) so as to embrace a more general setup that covers various algorithms in
machine learning. Then, we study classical support vector methods - including
SVM (Support Vector Machine), SVR (Support Vector Regression) and SVDD (Support
Vector Data Description) - and derive new results for the ability of these
methods to generalize. All results are valid for any finite size of the data
set. When the sample size tends to infinity, we establish the unprecedented
result that the risk approaches the ratio between the complexity and the
cardinality of the data sample, regardless of the value of the complexity.

  Analysis for Targeted Interventions",,,,,cs.CY cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Problem definition: Traditionally, New York City's top 8 public schools have
selected candidates solely based on their scores in the Specialized High School
Admissions Test (SHSAT). These scores are known to be impacted by socioeconomic
status of students and test preparation received in middle schools, leading to
a massive filtering effect in the education pipeline. The classical mechanisms
for assigning students to schools do not naturally address problems like school
segregation and class diversity, which have worsened over the years. The
scientific community, including policymakers, have reacted by incorporating
group-specific quotas and proportionality constraints, with mixed results. The
problem of finding effective and fair methods for broadening access to
top-notch education is still unsolved.
  Methodology/results: We take an operations approach to the problem different
from most established literature, with the goal of increasing opportunities for
students with high economic needs. Using data from the Department of Education
(DOE) in New York City, we show that there is a shift in the distribution of
scores obtained by students that the DOE classifies as ""disadvantaged""
(following criteria mostly based on economic factors). We model this shift as a
""bias"" that results from an underestimation of the true potential of
disadvantaged students. We analyze the impact this bias has on an assortative
matching market. We show that centrally planned interventions can significantly
reduce the impact of bias through scholarships or training, when they target
the segment of disadvantaged students with average performance.

  White, and Carey E. Priebe",A Simple Lifelong Learning Approach,,,,,cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In lifelong learning, data are used to improve performance not only on the
present task, but also on past and future (unencountered) tasks. While typical
transfer learning algorithms can improve performance on future tasks, their
performance on prior tasks degrades upon learning new tasks (called
forgetting). Many recent approaches for continual or lifelong learning have
attempted to maintain performance on old tasks given new tasks. But striving to
avoid forgetting sets the goal unnecessarily low. The goal of lifelong learning
should be to use data to improve performance on both future tasks (forward
transfer) and past tasks (backward transfer). In this paper, we show that a
simple approach -- representation ensembling -- demonstrates both forward and
backward transfer in a variety of simulated and benchmark data scenarios,
including tabular, vision (CIFAR-100, 5-dataset, Split Mini-Imagenet, and
Food1k), and speech (spoken digit), in contrast to various reference
algorithms, which typically failed to transfer either forward or backward, or
both. Moreover, our proposed approach can flexibly operate with or without a
computational budget.

predictive models and their decisions, but many such methods are limited to
producing insights with respect to a single class. When generating explanations
for several classes, reasoning over them to obtain a complete view may be
difficult since they can present competing or contradictory evidence. To
address this challenge we introduce the novel paradigm of multi-class
explanations. We outline the theory behind such techniques and propose a local
surrogate model based on multi-output regression trees -- called LIMEtree --
that offers faithful and consistent explanations of multiple classes for
individual predictions while being post-hoc, model-agnostic and data-universal.
On top of strong fidelity guarantees, our implementation delivers a range of
diverse explanation types, including counterfactual statements favoured in the
literature. We evaluate our algorithm with respect to explainability
desiderata, through quantitative experiments and via a pilot user study, on
image and tabular data classification tasks, comparing it to LIME, which is a
state-of-the-art surrogate explainer. Our contributions demonstrate the
benefits of multi-class explanations and wide-ranging advantages of our method
across a diverse set of scenarios.

consistent in every metric space whose separable subspaces are sigma-finite
dimensional in the sense of Nagata and Preiss if and only if there are no
real-valued measurable cardinals. The latter assumption is relatively
consistent with ZFC, however the consistency of the existence of such cardinals

the parameterization of a category with a Lawvere theory. We show how these
extensions relate to the category Stoch and other Markov Categories. Next, we
apply the Para construction to extend stochastic processes to parameterized
statistical models and we define a way to compose the likelihood functions of
these models. We conclude with a demonstration of how the Maximum Likelihood

of statistical models to the category of Learners. Code to accompany this paper

practical applications. The major difficulty in solving such a problem concerns
nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics with time-varying characteristics. Takens'
delay embedding theory provides a way to transform high-dimensional spatial
information into temporal information. In this work, by combining delay
embedding theory and deep learning techniques, we propose a novel framework,
Delay-Embedding-based Forecast Machine (DEFM), to predict the future values of
a target variable in a self-supervised and multistep-ahead manner based on
high-dimensional observations. With a three-module spatiotemporal architecture,
the DEFM leverages deep neural networks to effectively extract both the
spatially and temporally associated information from the observed time series
even with time-varying parameters or additive noise. The DEFM can accurately
predict future information by transforming spatiotemporal information to the
delay embeddings of a target variable. The efficacy and precision of the DEFM
are substantiated through applications in three spatiotemporally chaotic
systems: a 90-dimensional (90D) coupled Lorenz system, the Lorenz 96 system,
and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation with inhomogeneity. Additionally,
the performance of the DEFM is evaluated on six real-world datasets spanning
various fields. Comparative experiments with five prediction methods illustrate
the superiority and robustness of the DEFM and show the great potential of the
DEFM in temporal information mining and forecasting

currently available for history matching. However, because these methods rely
on Gaussian assumptions, their performance is severely degraded when the prior
geology is described in terms of complex facies distributions. Inspired by the
impressive results obtained by deep generative networks in areas such as image
and video generation, we started an investigation focused on the use of
autoencoders networks to construct a continuous parameterization for facies
models. In our previous publication, we combined a convolutional variational
autoencoder (VAE) with the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation
(ES-MDA) for history matching production data in models generated with
multiple-point geostatistics. Despite the good results reported in our previous
publication, a major limitation of the designed parameterization is the fact
that it does not allow applying distance-based localization during the ensemble
smoother update, which limits its application in large-scale problems.
  The present work is a continuation of this research project focusing in two
aspects: firstly, we benchmark seven different formulations, including VAE,
generative adversarial network (GAN), Wasserstein GAN, variational
auto-encoding GAN, principal component analysis (PCA) with cycle GAN, PCA with
transfer style network and VAE with style loss. These formulations are tested
in a synthetic history matching problem with channelized facies. Secondly, we
propose two strategies to allow the use of distance-based localization with the
deep learning parameterizations.

  Networks",,,,,eess.SP cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can potentially meet the high
data-rate requirements of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. However, as
the prerequisite of mmWave communications, the narrow directional beam tracking
is very challenging because of the three-dimensional (3D) mobility and attitude
variation of UAVs. Aiming to address the beam tracking difficulties, we propose
to integrate the conformal array (CA) with the surface of each UAV, which
enables the full spatial coverage and the agile beam tracking in highly dynamic
UAV mmWave networks. More specifically, the key contributions of our work are
three-fold. 1) A new mmWave beam tracking framework is established for the
CA-enabled UAV mmWave network. 2) A specialized hierarchical codebook is
constructed to drive the directional radiating element (DRE)-covered
cylindrical conformal array (CCA), which contains both the angular beam pattern
and the subarray pattern to fully utilize the potential of the CA. 3) A
codebook-based multiuser beam tracking scheme is proposed, where the Gaussian
process machine learning enabled UAV position/attitude predication is developed
to improve the beam tracking efficiency in conjunction with the tracking-error
aware adaptive beamwidth control. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
of the proposed codebook-based beam tracking scheme in the CA-enabled UAV
mmWave network, and demonstrate the advantages of CA over the conventional
planner array in terms of spectrum efficiency and outage probability in the
highly dynamic scenarios.

  Time-Series",,,,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Leveraging the symmetries inherent to specific data domains for the
construction of equivariant neural networks has lead to remarkable improvements
in terms of data efficiency and generalization. However, most existing research
focuses on symmetries arising from planar and volumetric data, leaving a
crucial data source largely underexplored: time-series. In this work, we fill
this gap by leveraging the symmetries inherent to time-series for the
construction of equivariant neural network. We identify two core symmetries:
*scale and translation*, and construct scale-translation equivariant neural
networks for time-series learning. Intriguingly, we find that scale-translation
equivariant mappings share strong resemblance with the wavelet transform.
Inspired by this resemblance, we term our networks Wavelet Networks, and show
that they perform nested non-linear wavelet-like time-frequency transforms.
Empirical results show that Wavelet Networks outperform conventional CNNs on
raw waveforms, and match strongly engineered spectrogram techniques across
several tasks and time-series types, including audio, environmental sounds, and
electrical signals. Our code is publicly available at

elections are based on the selection of top-ranking individuals from a larger
pool of candidates. This process is often subject to biases, which typically
manifest as an under-representation of certain groups among the selected or
accepted individuals. The most common approach to this issue is debiasing, for
example via the introduction of quotas that ensure proportional representation
of groups with respect to a certain, often binary attribute. Cases include
quotas for women on corporate boards or ethnic quotas in elections. This,
however, has the potential to induce changes in representation with respect to
other attributes. For the case of two correlated binary attributes we show that
quota-based debiasing based on a single attribute can worsen the representation
of already underrepresented groups and decrease overall fairness of selection.
We use several data sets from a broad range of domains from recidivism risk
assessments to scientific citations to assess this effect in real-world
settings. Our results demonstrate the importance of including all relevant
attributes in debiasing procedures and that more efforts need to be put into
eliminating the root causes of inequalities as purely numerical solutions such
as quota-based debiasing might lead to unintended consequences.

measured intensity alone, is an inverse problem that is widely faced in various
imaging modalities ranging from astronomy to nanoscale imaging. The current
process of phase recovery is iterative in nature. As a result, the image
formation is time-consuming and computationally expensive, precluding real-time
imaging. Here, we use 3D nanoscale X-ray imaging as a representative example to
develop a deep learning model to address this phase retrieval problem. We
introduce 3D-CDI-NN, a deep convolutional neural network and differential
programming framework trained to predict 3D structure and strain solely from
input 3D X-ray coherent scattering data. Our networks are designed to be
""physics-aware"" in multiple aspects; in that the physics of x-ray scattering
process is explicitly enforced in the training of the network, and the training
data are drawn from atomistic simulations that are representative of the
physics of the material. We further refine the neural network prediction
through a physics-based optimization procedure to enable maximum accuracy at
lowest computational cost. 3D-CDI-NN can invert a 3D coherent diffraction
pattern to real-space structure and strain hundreds of times faster than
traditional iterative phase retrieval methods, with negligible loss in
accuracy. Our integrated machine learning and differential programming solution
to the phase retrieval problem is broadly applicable across inverse problems in
other application areas.

analyse the observed data, thus usually only few known anomalies if any are
available. Inspired by generative models and the analysis of the hidden
activations of neural networks, we introduce a novel unsupervised anomaly
detection method called DA3D. Here, we use adversarial autoencoders to generate
anomalous counterexamples based on the normal data only. These artificial
anomalies used during training allow the detection of real, yet unseen

motion of a 3D human skeleton from monocular video.While previous methods rely
on either rigging or inverse kinematics (IK) to associate a consistent skeleton
with temporally coherent joint rotations, our method is the first data-driven
approach that directly outputs a kinematic skeleton, which is a complete,
commonly used, motion representation. At the crux of our approach lies a deep
neural network with embedded kinematic priors, which decomposes sequences of 2D
joint positions into two separate attributes: a single, symmetric, skeleton,
encoded by bone lengths, and a sequence of 3D joint rotations associated with
global root positions and foot contact labels. These attributes are fed into an
integrated forward kinematics (FK) layer that outputs 3D positions, which are
compared to a ground truth. In addition, an adversarial loss is applied to the
velocities of the recovered rotations, to ensure that they lie on the manifold
of natural joint rotations. The key advantage of our approach is that it learns
to infer natural joint rotations directly from the training data, rather than
assuming an underlying model, or inferring them from joint positions using a
data-agnostic IK solver. We show that enforcing a single consistent skeleton
along with temporally coherent joint rotations constrains the solution space,
leading to a more robust handling of self-occlusions and depth ambiguities.

in a supervised learning context, allowing not only the mean function but the
entire density of the output to change with the inputs. Sparse Gaussian
processes (GP) have shown promise as a leading candidate for the experts in
such models, and in this article, we propose to design the gating network for
selecting the experts from such mixtures of sparse GPs using a deep neural
network (DNN). Furthermore, a fast one pass algorithm called
Cluster-Classify-Regress (CCR) is leveraged to approximate the maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimator extremely quickly. This powerful combination of
model and algorithm together delivers a novel method which is flexible, robust,
and extremely efficient. In particular, the method is able to outperform
competing methods in terms of accuracy and uncertainty quantification. The cost
is competitive on low-dimensional and small data sets, but is significantly
lower for higher-dimensional and big data sets. Iteratively maximizing the
distribution of experts given allocations and allocations given experts does
not provide significant improvement, which indicates that the algorithm
achieves a good approximation to the local MAP estimator very fast. This
insight can be useful also in the context of other mixture of experts models.

co-existence that employs separate transmit/receive units. The purpose of this

addresses all of these issues. In this paper, we propose signal processing for
a distributed IBFD MRMC, where radar receiver is designed to additionally
exploit the downlink communications signals reflected from a radar target.
Extensive numerical experiments show that our methods improve radar target
detection over conventional codes and yield a higher achievable data rate than

two different grains: intra-space (within the same feature space) and
inter-space (between two different feature spaces). The proposed strategy
designs a novel frequency-aware regularization to boost the intra-space SvF

form of data, for example in geochemical analysis of soil. In practical
considerations predictions of these measurements at unobserved locations are of
great interest. For standard multivariate spatial prediction methods it is
mandatory to not only model spatial dependencies but also cross-dependencies
which makes it a demanding task. Recently, a blind source separation approach
for spatial data was suggested. When using this spatial blind source separation
method prior the actual spatial prediction, modelling of spatial
cross-dependencies is avoided, which in turn simplifies the spatial prediction
task significantly. In this paper we investigate the use of spatial blind
source separation as a pre-processing tool for spatial prediction and compare
it with predictions from Cokriging and neural networks in an extensive
simulation study as well as a geochemical dataset.

classification method to work with the large data-set and use the concept of
pseudo or inducing inputs. We perform the same with different sets of kernels
and the different number of inducing data points to show the best accuracy was
obtained with the selection of RBF kernel with a higher number of inducing

stochastic nature of our method employed and also good test accuracy with low

Using the methodologies of Bayesian learning techniques with the incorporated

predict a time-to-event outcome while simultaneously learning a topic model
that reveals feature relationships. In particular, we model each subject as a
distribution over ""topics"", where a topic could, for instance, correspond to an
age group, a disorder, or a disease. The presence of a topic in a subject means
that specific clinical features are more likely to appear for the subject.
Topics encode information about related features and are learned in a
supervised manner to predict a time-to-event outcome. Our framework supports
combining many different topic and survival models; training the resulting
joint survival-topic model readily scales to large datasets using standard
neural net optimizers with minibatch gradient descent. For example, a special
case is to combine LDA with a Cox model, in which case a subject's distribution
over topics serves as the input feature vector to the Cox model. We explain how
to address practical implementation issues that arise when applying these
neural survival-supervised topic models to clinical data, including how to
visualize results to assist clinical interpretation. We study the effectiveness
of our proposed framework on seven clinical datasets on predicting time until
death as well as hospital ICU length of stay, where we find that neural
survival-supervised topic models achieve competitive accuracy with existing
approaches while yielding interpretable clinical topics that explain feature
relationships. Our code is available at:

a challenging, highly ill-posed problem with practical implications in medical
and biological imaging, manufacturing, automation, and environmental and food
security. Regularizing priors are necessary to reduce artifacts by improving
the condition of such problems. Recently, it was shown that one effective way
to learn the priors for strongly scattering yet highly structured 3D objects,
e.g. layered and Manhattan, is by a static neural network [Goy et al, Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. 116, 19848-19856 (2019)]. Here, we present a radically
different approach where the collection of raw images from multiple angles is
viewed analogously to a dynamical system driven by the object-dependent forward
scattering operator. The sequence index in angle of illumination plays the role
of discrete time in the dynamical system analogy. Thus, the imaging problem
turns into a problem of nonlinear system identification, which also suggests
dynamical learning as better fit to regularize the reconstructions. We devised
a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture with a novel split-convolutional
gated recurrent unit (SC-GRU) as the fundamental building block. Through
comprehensive comparison of several quantitative metrics, we show that the

  Training",,,10.1007/s11432-022-3892-8,,stat.ML cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Stochastic gradient descent~(SGD) and its variants have been the dominating
optimization methods in machine learning. Compared to SGD with small-batch
training, SGD with large-batch training can better utilize the computational
power of current multi-core systems such as graphics processing units~(GPUs)
and can reduce the number of communication rounds in distributed training
settings. Thus, SGD with large-batch training has attracted considerable
attention. However, existing empirical results showed that large-batch training
typically leads to a drop in generalization accuracy. Hence, how to guarantee
the generalization ability in large-batch training becomes a challenging task.
In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method, called stochastic
normalized gradient descent with momentum~(SNGM), for large-batch training. We
prove that with the same number of gradient computations, SNGM can adopt a
larger batch size than momentum SGD~(MSGD), which is one of the most widely
used variants of SGD, to converge to an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Empirical
results on deep learning verify that when adopting the same large batch size,
SNGM can achieve better test accuracy than MSGD and other state-of-the-art
large-batch training methods.

estimator for multivariate location and scatter, which detects outliers by
fitting a robust covariance matrix to the data. Its regularization ensures that
the covariance matrix is well-conditioned in any dimension. The MRCD assumes
that the non-outlying observations are roughly elliptically distributed, but
many datasets are not of that form. Moreover, the computation time of MRCD
increases substantially when the number of variables goes up, and nowadays
datasets with many variables are common. The proposed Kernel Minimum
Regularized Covariance Determinant (KMRCD) estimator addresses both issues. It
is not restricted to elliptical data because it implicitly computes the MRCD
estimates in a kernel induced feature space. A fast algorithm is constructed
that starts from kernel-based initial estimates and exploits the kernel trick
to speed up the subsequent computations. Based on the KMRCD estimates, a rule
is proposed to flag outliers. The KMRCD algorithm performs well in simulations,
and is illustrated on real-life data.

training and testing samples come from the same population, practice belies
this fiction. One strategy -- coming from robust statistics and optimization --
is thus to build a model robust to distributional perturbations. In this paper,
we take a different approach to describe procedures for robust predictive
inference, where a model provides uncertainty estimates on its predictions
rather than point predictions. We present a method that produces prediction
sets (almost exactly) giving the right coverage level for any test distribution
in an $f$-divergence ball around the training population. The method, based on
conformal inference, achieves (nearly) valid coverage in finite samples, under
only the condition that the training data be exchangeable. An essential
component of our methodology is to estimate the amount of expected future data
shift and build robustness to it; we develop estimators and prove their
consistency for protection and validity of uncertainty estimates under shifts.
By experimenting on several large-scale benchmark datasets, including Recht et
al.'s CIFAR-v4 and ImageNet-V2 datasets, we provide complementary empirical
results that highlight the importance of robust predictive validity.

physics are getting more and more common. However, in many cases the result is
just utilized as a point prediction. Statistical uncertainties, coverage,
systematic uncertainties or a goodness-of-fit measure are often not calculated.
Here we describe a certain choice of training and network architecture that
allows to incorporate all these properties into a single network model. We show
that a KL-divergence objective of the joint distribution of data and labels
allows to unify supervised learning and variational autoencoders (VAEs) under
one umbrella of stochastic variational inference. The unification motivates an
extended supervised learning scheme which allows to calculate a goodness-of-fit
p-value for the neural network model. Conditional normalizing flows amortized
with a neural network are crucial in this construction. We discuss how to
calculate coverage probabilities without numerical integration for specific
""base-ordered"" contours that are unique to normalizing flows. Furthermore we
show how systematic uncertainties can be included via effective marginalization
during training. The proposed extended supervised training incorporates (1)
coverage calculation, (2) systematics and (3) a goodness-of-fit measure in a
single machine-learning model. There are in principle no constraints on the
shape of the involved distributions, in fact the machinery works with complex
multi-modal distributions defined on product spaces like $\mathbb{R}^n \times
\mathbb{S}^m$. The coverage calculation, however, requires care in its
interpretation when the distributions are too degenerate. We see great
potential for exploiting this per-event information in event selections or for
fast astronomical alerts which require uncertainty guarantees.

model-locking scheme, which ensures that a locked model functions correctly
only upon applying the correct secret key. The proposed scheme, known as
Deep-Lock, utilizes S-Boxes with good security properties to encrypt each

  Discovery* journal",,10.1007/s10618-024-01010-5,,cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Interpretable representations are the backbone of many explainers that target
black-box predictive systems based on artificial intelligence and machine
learning algorithms. They translate the low-level data representation necessary
for good predictive performance into high-level human-intelligible concepts
used to convey the explanatory insights. Notably, the explanation type and its
cognitive complexity are directly controlled by the interpretable
representation, tweaking which allows to target a particular audience and use
case. However, many explainers built upon interpretable representations
overlook their merit and fall back on default solutions that often carry
implicit assumptions, thereby degrading the explanatory power and reliability
of such techniques. To address this problem, we study properties of
interpretable representations that encode presence and absence of
human-comprehensible concepts. We demonstrate how they are operationalised for
tabular, image and text data; discuss their assumptions, strengths and
weaknesses; identify their core building blocks; and scrutinise their
configuration and parameterisation. In particular, this in-depth analysis
allows us to pinpoint their explanatory properties, desiderata and scope for
(malicious) manipulation in the context of tabular data where a linear model is
used to quantify the influence of interpretable concepts on a black-box
prediction. Our findings lead to a range of recommendations for designing
trustworthy interpretable representations; specifically, the benefits of
class-aware (supervised) discretisation of tabular data, e.g., with decision
trees, and sensitivity of image interpretable representations to segmentation
granularity and occlusion colour.

  publication consideration",,,,stat.ML cs.LG physics.geo-ph,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Bayesian geoacoustic inversion problems are conventionally solved by Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods or its variants, which are computationally expensive.
This paper extends the classic Bayesian geoacoustic inversion framework by
deriving important geoacoustic statistics of Bayesian geoacoustic inversion
from the multidimensional posterior probability density (PPD) using the mixture
density network (MDN) theory. These statistics make it convenient to train the
network directly on the whole parameter space and get the multidimensional PPD
of model parameters. The present approach provides a much more efficient way to
solve geoacoustic inversion problems in Bayesian inference framework. The
network is trained on a simulated dataset of surface-wave dispersion curves
with shear-wave velocities as labels and tested on both synthetic and real data
cases. The results show that the network gives reliable predictions and has
good generalization performance on unseen data. Once trained, the network can
rapidly (within seconds) give a fully probabilistic solution which is
comparable to Monte Carlo methods. It provides an promising approach for
real-time inversion.

  result in population norm was added in Corollary 1",,,,stat.ML cs.LG math.ST stat.TH,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We present a novel data-driven strategy to choose the hyperparameter $k$ in
the $k$-NN regression estimator without using any hold-out data. We treat the
problem of choosing the hyperparameter as an iterative procedure (over $k$) and
propose using an easily implemented in practice strategy based on the idea of
early stopping and the minimum discrepancy principle. This model selection
strategy is proven to be minimax-optimal over some smoothness function classes,
for instance, the Lipschitz functions class on a bounded domain. The novel
method often improves statistical performance on artificial and real-world data
sets in comparison to other model selection strategies, such as the Hold-out
method, 5-fold cross-validation, and AIC criterion. The novelty of the strategy
comes from reducing the computational time of the model selection procedure
while preserving the statistical (minimax) optimality of the resulting
estimator. More precisely, given a sample of size $n$, if one should choose $k$
among $\left\{ 1, \ldots, n \right\}$, and $\left\{ f^1, \ldots, f^n \right\}$
are the estimators of the regression function, the minimum discrepancy
principle requires the calculation of a fraction of the estimators, while this
is not the case for the generalized cross-validation, Akaike's AIC criteria, or
Lepskii principle.

However,
what methods and conclusions should we endorse as we move from analytics
in-the-small (dealing with a handful of projects) to analytics in-the-large
(dealing with hundreds of projects)?
  To answer this question, we recheck prior small-scale results (about process
versus product metrics for defect prediction and the granularity of metrics)
using 722,471 commits from 700 Github projects. We find that some analytics
in-the-small conclusions still hold when scaling up to analytics in-the-large.
For example, like prior work, we see that process metrics are better predictors
for defects than product metrics (best process/product-based learners
respectively achieve recalls of 98\%/44\% and AUCs of 95\%/54\%, median
values).
  That said, we warn that it is unwise to trust metric importance results from
analytics in-the-small studies since those change dramatically when moving to
analytics in-the-large. Also, when reasoning in-the-large about hundreds of
projects, it is better to use predictions from multiple models (since single
model predictions can become confused and exhibit a high variance).

optimization problems where one of the constraints is an optimization problem
itself. These problems are typically non-convex and strongly NP-Hard. Recently,
there has been an increased interest from the evolutionary computation
community to model bilevel problems due to its applicability in the real-world
applications for decision-making problems. In this work, a partial nested
evolutionary approach with a local heuristic search has been proposed to solve
the benchmark problems and have outstanding results. This approach relies on
the concept of intermarriage-crossover in search of feasible regions by
exploiting information from the constraints. A new variant has also been
proposed to the commonly used convergence approaches, i.e., optimistic and
pessimistic. It is called extreme optimistic approach. The experimental results
demonstrate the algorithm converges differently to known optimum solutions with
the optimistic variants. Optimistic approach also outperforms pessimistic
approach. Comparative statistical analysis of our approach with other recently
published partial to complete evolutionary approaches demonstrates very
competitive results.

a spectral case. Current RFFs-based kernel learning methods usually work in a
two-stage way. In the first-stage process, learning the optimal feature map is
often formulated as a target alignment problem, which aims to align the learned
kernel with the pre-defined target kernel (usually the ideal kernel). In the
second-stage process, a linear learner is conducted with respect to the mapped
random features. Nevertheless, the pre-defined kernel in target alignment is
not necessarily optimal for the generalization of the linear learner. Instead,
in this paper, we consider a one-stage process that incorporates the kernel
learning and linear learner into a unifying framework. To be specific, a
generative network via RFFs is devised to implicitly learn the kernel, followed
by a linear classifier parameterized as a full-connected layer. Then the
generative network and the classifier are jointly trained by solving the
empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem to reach a one-stage solution. This
end-to-end scheme naturally allows deeper features, in correspondence to a
multi-layer structure, and shows superior generalization performance over the
classical two-stage, RFFs-based methods in real-world classification tasks.
Moreover, inspired by the randomized resampling mechanism of the proposed
method, its enhanced adversarial robustness is investigated and experimentally
verified.

common set of samples arise in many scientific applications. A common problem
in the exploratory analysis of such data is to identify groups of features of
different data types that are strongly associated. A bimodule is a pair (A,B)
of feature sets from two data types such that the aggregate cross-correlation
between the features in A and those in B is large. A bimodule (A,B) is stable
if A coincides with the set of features that have significant aggregate
correlation with the features in B, and vice-versa. This paper proposes an
iterative-testing based bimodule search procedure (BSP) to identify stable
bimodules.
  Compared to existing methods for detecting cross-correlated features, BSP was
the best at recovering true bimodules with sufficient signal, while limiting
the false discoveries. In addition, we applied BSP to the problem of expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis using data from the GTEx consortium.
BSP identified several thousand SNP-gene bimodules. While many of the
individual SNP-gene pairs appearing in the discovered bimodules were identified
by standard eQTL methods, the discovered bimodules revealed genomic subnetworks
that appeared to be biologically meaningful and worthy of further scientific
investigation.

case of intrusion prevention. Following this method, we model the interaction
between an attacker and a defender as a Markov game and let attack and defense
strategies evolve through reinforcement learning and self-play without human
intervention. Using a simple infrastructure configuration, we demonstrate that
effective security strategies can emerge from self-play. This shows that
self-play, which has been applied in other domains with great success, can be
effective in the context of network security. Inspection of the converged
policies show that the emerged policies reflect common-sense knowledge and are
similar to strategies of humans. Moreover, we address known challenges of
reinforcement learning in this domain and present an approach that uses
function approximation, an opponent pool, and an autoregressive policy
representation. Through evaluations we show that our method is superior to two
baseline methods but that policy convergence in self-play remains a challenge.

Glass, Jimeng Sun",MIMOSA: Multi-constraint Molecule Sampling for Molecule Optimization,Accepted by AAAI 2021,,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Molecule optimization is a fundamental task for accelerating drug discovery,
with the goal of generating new valid molecules that maximize multiple drug
properties while maintaining similarity to the input molecule. Existing
generative models and reinforcement learning approaches made initial success,
but still face difficulties in simultaneously optimizing multiple drug
properties. To address such challenges, we propose the MultI-constraint
MOlecule SAmpling (MIMOSA) approach, a sampling framework to use input molecule
as an initial guess and sample molecules from the target distribution. MIMOSA
first pretrains two property agnostic graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecule
topology and substructure-type prediction, where a substructure can be either
atom or single ring. For each iteration, MIMOSA uses the GNNs' prediction and
employs three basic substructure operations (add, replace, delete) to generate
new molecules and associated weights. The weights can encode multiple
constraints including similarity and drug property constraints, upon which we
select promising molecules for next iteration. MIMOSA enables flexible encoding
of multiple property- and similarity-constraints and can efficiently generate
new molecules that satisfy various property constraints and achieved up to
49.6% relative improvement over the best baseline in terms of success rate. The
code repository (including readme file, data preprocessing and model
construction, evaluation) is available https://github.com/futianfan/MIMOSA.

  Robust Learning Approach",IJCAI 2023,,,,cs.LG cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We propose a framework for learning calibrated uncertainties under domain
shifts, where the source (training) distribution differs from the target (test)
distribution. We detect such domain shifts via a differentiable density ratio
estimator and train it together with the task network, composing an adjusted
softmax predictive form concerning domain shift. In particular, the density
ratio estimation reflects the closeness of a target (test) sample to the source
(training) distribution. We employ it to adjust the uncertainty of prediction
in the task network. This idea of using the density ratio is based on the
distributionally robust learning (DRL) framework, which accounts for the domain
shift by adversarial risk minimization. We show that our proposed method
generates calibrated uncertainties that benefit downstream tasks, such as
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semi-supervised learning (SSL). On
these tasks, methods like self-training and FixMatch use uncertainties to
select confident pseudo-labels for re-training. Our experiments show that the
introduction of DRL leads to significant improvements in cross-domain
performance. We also show that the estimated density ratios align with human
selection frequencies, suggesting a positive correlation with a proxy of human
perceived uncertainties.

  Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), PMLR 206:3931-3960, 2023",,,stat.ML cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The central objective function of a variational autoencoder (VAE) is its
variational lower bound (the ELBO). Here we show that for standard (i.e.,
Gaussian) VAEs the ELBO converges to a value given by the sum of three
entropies: the (negative) entropy of the prior distribution, the expected
(negative) entropy of the observable distribution, and the average entropy of
the variational distributions (the latter is already part of the ELBO). Our
derived analytical results are exact and apply for small as well as for
intricate deep networks for encoder and decoder. Furthermore, they apply for
finitely and infinitely many data points and at any stationary point (including
local maxima and saddle points). The result implies that the ELBO can for
standard VAEs often be computed in closed-form at stationary points while the
original ELBO requires numerical approximations of integrals. As a main
contribution, we provide the proof that the ELBO for VAEs is at stationary
points equal to entropy sums. Numerical experiments then show that the obtained
analytical results are sufficiently precise also in those vicinities of
stationary points that are reached in practice. Furthermore, we discuss how the
novel entropy form of the ELBO can be used to analyze and understand learning
behavior. More generally, we believe that our contributions can be useful for
future theoretical and practical studies on VAE learning as they provide novel
information on those points in parameters space that optimization of VAEs
converges to.

the classes on which they will eventually be applied. Hence, their final
accuracy remains unknown. In this work we study how a classifier's performance
over the initial class sample can be used to extrapolate its expected accuracy
on a larger, unobserved set of classes. For this, we define a measure of
separation between correct and incorrect classes that is independent of the
number of classes: the ""reversed ROC"" (rROC), which is obtained by replacing
the roles of classes and data-points in the common ROC. We show that the
classification accuracy is a function of the rROC in multiclass classifiers,
for which the learned representation of data from the initial class sample
remains unchanged when new classes are added. Using these results we formulate
a robust neural-network-based algorithm, ""CleaneX"", which learns to estimate
the accuracy of such classifiers on arbitrarily large sets of classes. Unlike
previous methods, our method uses both the observed accuracies of the
classifier and densities of classification scores, and therefore achieves
remarkably better predictions than current state-of-the-art methods on both
simulations and real datasets of object detection, face recognition, and brain
decoding.

views (i.e. different feature sets) describing the same set of objects. In this
framework, a base-learner algorithm is trained on each view separately, and
their predictions are then combined by a meta-learner algorithm. In a previous
study, stacked penalized logistic regression, a special case of multi-view
stacking, has been shown to be useful in identifying which views are most
important for prediction. In this article we expand this research by
considering seven different algorithms to use as the meta-learner, and
evaluating their view selection and classification performance in simulations
and two applications on real gene-expression data sets. Our results suggest
that if both view selection and classification accuracy are important to the
research at hand, then the nonnegative lasso, nonnegative adaptive lasso and
nonnegative elastic net are suitable meta-learners. Exactly which among these
three is to be preferred depends on the research context. The remaining four
meta-learners, namely nonnegative ridge regression, nonnegative forward
selection, stability selection and the interpolating predictor, show little
advantages in order to be preferred over the other three.

  2021",cs.LG stat.ML,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  This paper prescribes a distance between learning tasks modeled as joint
distributions on data and labels. Using tools in information geometry, the
distance is defined to be the length of the shortest weight trajectory on a
Riemannian manifold as a classifier is fitted on an interpolated task. The
interpolated task evolves from the source to the target task using an optimal
transport formulation. This distance, which we call the ""coupled transfer
distance"" can be compared across different classifier architectures. We develop
an algorithm to compute the distance which iteratively transports the marginal
on the data of the source task to that of the target task while updating the
weights of the classifier to track this evolving data distribution. We develop
theory to show that our distance captures the intuitive idea that a good
transfer trajectory is the one that keeps the generalization gap small during
transfer, in particular at the end on the target task. We perform thorough
empirical validation and analysis across diverse image classification datasets
to show that the coupled transfer distance correlates strongly with the
difficulty of fine-tuning.

increasingly needed to realize the full potential of robots for society. While
spoken language must be part of the solution, our ability to provide spoken
language interaction capabilities is still very limited. The National Science
Foundation accordingly convened a workshop, bringing together speech, language,
and robotics researchers to discuss what needs to be done. The result is this
report, in which we identify key scientific and engineering advances needed.
  Our recommendations broadly relate to eight general themes. First, meeting
human needs requires addressing new challenges in speech technology and user
experience design. Second, this requires better models of the social and
interactive aspects of language use. Third, for robustness, robots need
higher-bandwidth communication with users and better handling of uncertainty,
including simultaneous consideration of multiple hypotheses and goals. Fourth,
more powerful adaptation methods are needed, to enable robots to communicate in
new environments, for new tasks, and with diverse user populations, without
extensive re-engineering or the collection of massive training data. Fifth,
since robots are embodied, speech should function together with other
communication modalities, such as gaze, gesture, posture, and motion. Sixth,
since robots operate in complex environments, speech components need access to
rich yet efficient representations of what the robot knows about objects,
locations, noise sources, the user, and other humans. Seventh, since robots
operate in real time, their speech and language processing components must
also. Eighth, in addition to more research, we need more work on infrastructure
and resources, including shareable software modules and internal interfaces,
inexpensive hardware, baseline systems, and diverse corpora.

techniques, e.g., nonlinear activation functions, batch normalization,
skip-connections, etc. Despite their effectiveness, it is still mysterious how
they help accelerate DNN trainings in practice. In this paper, we provide an
empirical study of the regularization effect of these training techniques on
DNN optimization. Specifically, we find that the optimization trajectories of
successful DNN trainings consistently obey a certain regularity principle that
regularizes the model update direction to be aligned with the trajectory
direction. Theoretically, we show that such a regularity principle leads to a
convergence guarantee in nonconvex optimization and the convergence rate
depends on a regularization parameter. Empirically, we find that DNN trainings
that apply the training techniques achieve a fast convergence and obey the
regularity principle with a large regularization parameter, implying that the
model updates are well aligned with the trajectory. On the other hand, DNN

extended halos of dark matter at late times can be computed using cosmological
simulations. However, a theoretical understanding of this complex process
remains elusive; in particular, the role of anisotropic information in the
initial conditions in establishing the final mass of dark matter halos remains
a long-standing puzzle. Here, we build a deep learning framework to investigate
this question. We train a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN)
to predict the mass of dark matter halos from the initial conditions, and
quantify in full generality the amounts of information in the isotropic and
anisotropic aspects of the initial density field about final halo masses. We
find that anisotropies add a small, albeit statistically significant amount of
information over that contained within spherical averages of the density field
about final halo mass. However, the overall scatter in the final mass
predictions does not change qualitatively with this additional information,
only decreasing from 0.9 dex to 0.7 dex. Given such a small improvement, our
results demonstrate that isotropic aspects of the initial density field
essentially saturate the relevant information about final halo mass. Therefore,
instead of searching for information directly encoded in initial conditions
anisotropies, a more promising route to accurate, fast halo mass predictions is
to add approximate dynamical information based e.g. on perturbation theory.
More broadly, our results indicate that deep learning frameworks can provide a
powerful tool for extracting physical insight into cosmological structure
formation.

is required for an electron to escape the surface of a material. This property
is crucial for thermionic energy conversion, band alignment in
heterostructures, and electron emission devices. Here, we present a
high-throughput workflow using density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the
work function and cleavage energy of 33,631 slabs (58,332 work functions) that
we created from 3,716 bulk materials, including up to ternary compounds. The
number of materials for which we calculated surface properties surpasses the
previously largest database, the Materials Project, by a factor of $\sim$27. On
the tail ends of the work function distribution we identify 34 and 56 surfaces
with an ultra-low (<2 eV) and ultra-high (>7 eV) work function, respectively.
Further, we discover that the $(100)$-Ba-O surface of BaMoO$_3$ and the
$(001)$-F surface of Ag$_2$F have record-low (1.25 eV) and record-high (9.06
eV) steady-state work functions without requiring coatings, respectively. Based
on this database we develop a physics-based approach to featurize surfaces and
use supervised machine learning to predict the work function. We find that
physical choice of features improves prediction performance far more than
choice of model. Our random forest model achieves a mean absolute test error of
0.09 eV, which is more than 6 times better than the baseline and comparable to
the accuracy of DFT. This surrogate model enables rapid predictions of the work
function ($\sim 10^5$ faster than DFT) across a vast chemical space and
facilitates the discovery of material surfaces with extreme work functions for
energy conversion, electronic applications, and contacts in 2-dimensional
devices.

data, and how to protect the privacy of training data has thus become a
critical topic in deep learning research. InstaHide is a state-of-the-art
scheme to protect training data privacy with only minor effects on test
accuracy, and its security has become a salient question. In this paper, we
systematically study recent attacks on InstaHide and present a unified
framework to understand and analyze these attacks. We find that existing
attacks either do not have a provable guarantee or can only recover a single
private image. On the current InstaHide challenge setup, where each InstaHide
image is a mixture of two private images, we present a new algorithm to recover
all the private images with a provable guarantee and optimal sample complexity.
In addition, we also provide a computational hardness result on retrieving all
InstaHide images. Our results demonstrate that InstaHide is not
information-theoretically secure but computationally secure in the worst case,
even when mixing two private images.

continual learning problems. Instead of tackling continual learning via the use
of external memory, growing models, or regularization, EBMs change the
underlying training objective to cause less interference with previously
learned information. Our proposed version of EBMs for continual learning is
simple, efficient, and outperforms baseline methods by a large margin on
several benchmarks. Moreover, our proposed contrastive divergence-based
training objective can be combined with other continual learning methods,
resulting in substantial boosts in their performance. We further show that EBMs
are adaptable to a more general continual learning setting where the data
distribution changes without the notion of explicitly delineated tasks. These
observations point towards EBMs as a useful building block for future continual
learning methods.

vectors is a fundamental step in most malaria elimination campaigns. However,
identification of such water bodies over large areas is expensive,
labour-intensive and time-consuming and hence, challenging in countries with
limited resources. Practical models that can efficiently locate water bodies
can target the limited resources by greatly reducing the area that needs to be
scanned by the field workers. To this end, we propose a practical topographic
model based on easily available, global, high-resolution DEM data to predict
locations of potential vector-breeding water sites. We surveyed the Obuasi
region of Ghana to assess the impact of various topographic features on
different types of water bodies and uncover the features that significantly
influence the formation of aquatic habitats. We further evaluate the
effectiveness of multiple models. Our best model significantly outperforms
earlier attempts that employ topographic variables for detection of small water
sites, even the ones that utilize additional satellite imagery data and
demonstrates robustness across different settings.

scheduling generation capacity, planning supply and demand, and minimizing
energy trade costs. Such relevance has increased even more in recent years due
to the integration of renewable energies, electric cars, and microgrids.
Conventional load forecasting techniques obtain single-value load forecasts by
exploiting consumption patterns of past load demand. However, such techniques
cannot assess intrinsic uncertainties in load demand, and cannot capture
dynamic changes in consumption patterns. To address these problems, this paper
presents a method for probabilistic load forecasting based on the adaptive
online learning of hidden Markov models. We propose learning and forecasting
techniques with theoretical guarantees, and experimentally assess their
performance in multiple scenarios. In particular, we develop adaptive online
learning techniques that update model parameters recursively, and sequential
prediction techniques that obtain probabilistic forecasts using the most recent
parameters. The performance of the method is evaluated using multiple datasets
corresponding with regions that have different sizes and display assorted
time-varying consumption patterns. The results show that the proposed method
can significantly improve the performance of existing techniques for a wide
range of scenarios.

the gradient as the descent direction, either as-is or after a direction shift
using preconditioning. In many scenarios calculating the gradient is
numerically hard due to complex or non-differentiable cost functions,
specifically next to singular points. In this work we focus on the derivation
of the Total Variation semi-norm commonly used in unsupervised cost functions.
Specifically, we derive a differentiable proxy to the hard L1 smoothness
constraint in a novel iterative scheme which we refer to as Cost Unrolling.
Producing more accurate gradients during training, our method enables finer
predictions of a given DNN model through improved convergence, without
modifying its architecture or increasing computational complexity. We
demonstrate our method in the unsupervised optical flow task. Replacing the L1
smoothness constraint with our unrolled cost during the training of a well
known baseline, we report improved results on both MPI Sintel and KITTI 2015
unsupervised optical flow benchmarks. Particularly, we report EPE reduced by up
to 15.82% on occluded pixels, where the smoothness constraint is dominant,
enabling the detection of much sharper motion edges.

,   Anomaly detection is a challenging task for machine learning algorithms due
to the inherent class imbalance. It is costly and time-demanding to manually
analyse the observed data, thus usually only few known anomalies if any are
available. Inspired by generative models and the analysis of the hidden
activations of neural networks, we introduce a novel unsupervised anomaly
detection method called DA3D. Here, we use adversarial autoencoders to generate
anomalous counterexamples based on the normal data only. These artificial
anomalies used during training allow the detection of real, yet unseen
anomalies. With our novel generative approach, we transform the unsupervised
task of anomaly detection to a supervised one, which is more tractable by
machine learning and especially deep learning methods. DA3D surpasses the
performance of state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in a purely

dictionary comprising synthetic landmarks, along with representation
coefficients supported on a simplex. KDS employs a local weighted $\ell_1$
penalty that encourages each data point to represent itself as a convex
combination of nearby landmarks. We solve the proposed optimization program
using alternating minimization and design an efficient, interpretable
autoencoder using algorithm unrolling. We theoretically analyze the proposed
program by relating the weighted $\ell_1$ penalty in KDS to a weighted $\ell_0$
program. Assuming that the data are generated from a Delaunay triangulation, we
prove the equivalence of the weighted $\ell_1$ and weighted $\ell_0$ programs.
We further show the stability of the representation coefficients under mild
geometrical assumptions. If the representation coefficients are fixed, we prove
that the sub-problem of minimizing over the dictionary yields a unique
solution. Further, we show that low-dimensional representations can be
efficiently obtained from the covariance of the coefficient matrix. Experiments
show that the algorithm is highly efficient and performs competitively on
synthetic and real data sets.

  in probabilistic matrix factorization",Fixed typo in Eq 2,,,ICLR 2021,cs.LG q-bio.QM stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,"  Dimensionality reduction methods for count data are critical to a wide range
of applications in medical informatics and other fields where model
interpretability is paramount. For such data, hierarchical Poisson matrix
factorization (HPF) and other sparse probabilistic non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF) methods are considered to be interpretable generative
models. They consist of sparse transformations for decoding their learned
representations into predictions. However, sparsity in representation decoding
does not necessarily imply sparsity in the encoding of representations from the
original data features. HPF is often incorrectly interpreted in the literature
as if it possesses encoder sparsity. The distinction between decoder sparsity
and encoder sparsity is subtle but important. Due to the lack of encoder
sparsity, HPF does not possess the column-clustering property of classical NMF
-- the factor loading matrix does not sufficiently define how each factor is
formed from the original features. We address this deficiency by
self-consistently enforcing encoder sparsity, using a generalized additive
model (GAM), thereby allowing one to relate each representation coordinate to a
subset of the original data features. In doing so, the method also gains the
ability to perform feature selection. We demonstrate our method on simulated
data and give an example of how encoder sparsity is of practical use in a
concrete application of representing inpatient comorbidities in Medicare
patients.

the classical set up of multi-class logistic regression in which each data
sample belongs to one class. We also provide a general and constructive
estimate of the convergence rate to the maximum likelihood estimate when
gradient descent is used as the optimizer. Our estimate involves bounding the
condition number of the Hessian of the maximum likelihood function. The

technique for identifying relationships between the structural properties of
chemical compounds and biological activity. QSAR modeling is necessary for drug
discovery, but it has many limitations. Ensemble-based machine learning
approaches have been used to overcome limitations and generate reliable
predictions. Ensemble learning creates a set of diverse models and combines
them. In our comparative analysis, each ensemble algorithm was paired with each
of the basic algorithms, but the basic algorithms were also investigated
separately. In this configuration, 57 algorithms were developed and compared on
4 different datasets. Thus, a technique for complex ensemble method is proposed
that builds diversified models and integrates them. The proposed individual
models did not show impressive results as a unified model, but it was
considered the most important predictor when combined. We assessed whether
ensembles always give better results than individual algorithms. The Python

  Meta-Learning",,,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  There is a growing interest in the learning-to-learn paradigm, also known as
meta-learning, where models infer on new tasks using a few training examples.
Recently, meta-learning based methods have been widely used in few-shot
classification, regression, reinforcement learning, and domain adaptation. The
model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm is a well-known algorithm that
obtains model parameter initialization at meta-training phase. In the meta-test
phase, this initialization is rapidly adapted to new tasks by using gradient
descent. However, meta-learning models are prone to overfitting since there are
insufficient training tasks resulting in over-parameterized models with poor
generalization performance for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose a
Bayesian neural network based MAML algorithm, which we refer to as the B-SMALL
algorithm. The proposed framework incorporates a sparse variational loss term
alongside the loss function of MAML, which uses a sparsifying approximated KL
divergence as a regularizer. We demonstrate the performance of B-MAML using
classification and regression tasks, and highlight that training a sparsifying
BNN using MAML indeed improves the parameter footprint of the model while
performing at par or even outperforming the MAML approach. We also illustrate
applicability of our approach in distributed sensor networks, where sparsity
and meta-learning can be beneficial.

that synthesizes ideas from recent multiscale and spectral approaches with
graphical models. The basis graphical lasso writes a univariate Gaussian
process as a linear combination of basis functions weighted with entries of a
Gaussian graphical vector whose graph is estimated from optimizing an $\ell_1$
penalized likelihood. This paper extends the setting to a multivariate Gaussian
process where the basis functions are weighted with Gaussian graphical vectors.
We motivate a model where the basis functions represent different levels of
resolution and the graphical vectors for each level are assumed to be
independent. Using an orthogonal basis grants linear complexity and memory
usage in the number of spatial locations, the number of basis functions, and
the number of realizations. An additional fusion penalty encourages a
parsimonious conditional independence structure in the multilevel graphical
model. We illustrate our method on a large climate ensemble from the National
Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Atmosphere Model that involves 40
spatial processes.

role in productivity and profit. A fermentation process uses living cells with
complex biological mechanisms, leading to high variability in the process
outputs, namely, the protein and impurity levels. By building on the biological
mechanisms of protein and impurity growth, we introduce a stochastic model to
characterize the accumulation of the protein and impurity levels in the
fermentation process. However, a common challenge in the industry is the
availability of only a very limited amount of data, especially in the
development and early stages of production. This adds an additional layer of
uncertainty, referred to as model risk, due to the difficulty of estimating the
model parameters with limited data. In this paper, we study the harvesting
decision for a fermentation process (i.e., when to stop the fermentation and
collect the production reward) under model risk. We adopt a Bayesian approach
to update the unknown parameters of the growth-rate distributions, and use the
resulting posterior distributions to characterize the impact of model risk on
fermentation output variability. The harvesting problem is formulated as a
Markov decision process model with knowledge states that summarize the
posterior distributions and hence incorporate the model risk in
decision-making. Our case studies at MSD Animal Health demonstrate that the
proposed model and solution approach improve the harvesting decisions in real
life by achieving substantially higher average output from a fermentation batch
along with lower batch-to-batch variability.

performance requires dealing with uncertainties. A conventional approach is to
add safety margins to a design that was obtained from deterministic
optimization. Safer engineering designs require appropriate cost and constraint
function definitions that capture the \textit{risk} associated with unwanted
system behavior in the presence of uncertainties. The paper proposes two
notions of certifiability. The first is based on accounting for the magnitude
of failure to ensure data-informed conservativeness. The second is the ability
to provide optimization convergence guarantees by preserving convexity.
Satisfying these notions leads to \textit{certifiable} risk-based design
optimization (CRiBDO). In the context of CRiBDO, risk measures based on
superquantile (a.k.a.\ conditional value-at-risk) and buffered probability of
failure are analyzed. CRiBDO is contrasted with reliability-based design
optimization (RBDO), where uncertainties are accounted for via the probability
of failure, through a structural and a thermal design problem. A reformulation
of the short column structural design problem leading to a convex CRiBDO
problem is presented. The CRiBDO formulations capture more information about
the problem to assign the appropriate conservativeness, exhibit superior
optimization convergence by preserving properties of underlying functions, and
alleviate the adverse effects of choosing hard failure thresholds required in
RBDO.

information for assessing the risk of a clinical event, and eventually for
adapting a therapeutic strategy. Joint models and landmark models have been
proposed to compute individual dynamic predictions from repeated measures to
one or two markers. However, they hardly extend to the case where the complete
patient history includes much more repeated markers possibly. Our objective was
thus to propose a solution for the dynamic prediction of a health event that
may exploit repeated measures of a possibly large number of markers. We
combined a landmark approach extended to endogenous markers history with
machine learning methods adapted to survival data. Each marker trajectory is
modeled using the information collected up to landmark time, and summary
variables that best capture the individual trajectories are derived. These
summaries and additional covariates are then included in different prediction
methods. To handle a possibly large dimensional history, we rely on machine
learning methods adapted to survival data, namely regularized regressions and
random survival forests, to predict the event from the landmark time, and we
show how they can be combined into a superlearner. Then, the performances are
evaluated by cross-validation using estimators of Brier Score and the area
under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve adapted to censored data. We
demonstrate in a simulation study the benefits of machine learning survival
methods over standard survival models, especially in the case of numerous
and/or nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the event. We then
applied the methodology in two prediction contexts: a clinical context with the
prediction of death for patients with primary biliary cholangitis, and a public
health context with the prediction of death in the general elderly population
at different ages. Our methodology, implemented in R, enables the prediction of
an event using the entire longitudinal patient history, even when the number of
repeated markers is large. Although introduced with mixed models for the
repeated markers and methods for a single right censored time-to-event, our
method can be used with any other appropriate modeling technique for the
markers and can be easily extended to competing risks setting.

simultaneously planning the routes of a fleet of vehicles and scheduling the
crews, where the vehicle-crew correspondence is not fixed through time. This
allows a greater planning flexibility and a more efficient use of the fleet,
but in counterpart, a high synchronisation is demanded. In this work, we
present a VRCSP where pickup-and-delivery requests with time windows have to be
fulfilled over a given planning horizon by using trucks and drivers. Crews can
be composed of 1 or 2 drivers and any of them can be relieved in a given set of
locations. Moreover, they are allowed to travel among locations with
non-company shuttles, at an additional cost that is minimised. As our problem
considers distinct routes for trucks and drivers, we have an additional
flexibility not contemplated in other previous VRCSP given in the literature
where a crew is handled as an indivisible unit. We tackle this problem with a
two-stage sequential approach: a set of truck routes is computed in the first
stage and a set of driver routes consistent with the truck routes is obtained
in the second one. We design and evaluate the performance of a metaheuristic
based algorithm for the latter stage. Our algorithm is mainly a GRASP with a
perturbation procedure that allows reusing solutions already found in case the
search for new solutions becomes difficult. This procedure together with other
to repair infeasible solutions allow us to find high-quality solutions on
instances of 100 requests spread across 15 cities with a fleet of 12-32 trucks
(depending on the planning horizon) in less than an hour. We also conclude that
the possibility of carrying an additional driver leads to a decrease of the

  Models",,Transactions on Machine Learning Research (2023),,,stat.ML cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The use of optimal transport cost for learning generative models has become
popular with Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN). Training of
WGAN relies on a theoretical background: the calculation of the gradient of the
optimal transport cost with respect to the generative model parameters. We
first demonstrate that such gradient may not be defined, which can result in
numerical instabilities during gradient-based optimization. We address this
issue by stating a valid differentiation theorem in the case of entropic
regularized transport and specify conditions under which existence is ensured.
By exploiting the discrete nature of empirical data, we formulate the gradient
in a semi-discrete setting and propose an algorithm for the optimization of the
generative model parameters. Finally, we illustrate numerically the advantage
of the proposed framework.

  contents and title",,,,cs.LG math.OC stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We introduce a multiple target optimization framework for DP-SGD referred to
as pro-active DP. In contrast to traditional DP accountants, which are used to
track the expenditure of privacy budgets, the pro-active DP scheme allows one
to a-priori select parameters of DP-SGD based on a fixed privacy budget (in
terms of $\epsilon$ and $\delta$) in such a way to optimize the anticipated
utility (test accuracy) the most. To achieve this objective, we first propose
significant improvements to the moment account method, presenting a closed-form
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee that connects all parameters in the DP-SGD
setup. We show that DP-SGD is $(\epsilon<0.5,\delta=1/N)$-DP if
$\sigma=\sqrt{2(\epsilon +\ln(1/\delta))/\epsilon}$ with $T$ at least $\approx
2k^2/\epsilon$ and $(2/e)^2k^2-1/2\geq \ln(N)$, where $T$ is the total number
of rounds, and $K=kN$ is the total number of gradient computations where $k$
measures $K$ in number of epochs of size $N$ of the local data set. We prove
that our expression is close to tight in that if $T$ is more than a constant
factor $\approx 4$ smaller than the lower bound $\approx 2k^2/\epsilon$, then
the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee is violated. The above DP guarantee can be
enhanced in thatDP-SGD is $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP if $\sigma =
\sqrt{2(\epsilon+\ln(1/\delta))/\epsilon}$ with $T$ at least $\approx
2k^2/\epsilon$ together with two additional, less intuitive, conditions that
allow larger $\epsilon\geq 0.5$. Our DP theory allows us to create a utility
graph and DP calculator. These tools link privacy and utility objectives and
search for optimal experiment setups, efficiently taking into account both
accuracy and privacy objectives, as well as implementation goals. We furnish a
comprehensive implementation flow of our proactive DP, with rigorous
experiments to showcase the proof-of-concept.

solutions to optimization problems (P) subject to a class of distributionally
uncertain dynamical systems. The introduced framework allows for the
simultaneous learning of distributional system uncertainty via a parameterized,
control-dependent ambiguity set using a finite historical data set, and its use
to make online decisions with probabilistic regret function bounds. Leveraging
the merits of Machine Learning, the main technical approach relies on the
theory of Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO), to hedge against
uncertainty and provide less conservative results than standard Robust
Optimization approaches. Starting from recent results that describe ambiguity
sets via parameterized, and control-dependent empirical distributions as well
as ambiguity radii, we first present a tractable reformulation of the
corresponding optimization problem while maintaining the probabilistic
guarantees. We then specialize these problems to the cases of 1) optimal
one-stage control of distributionally uncertain nonlinear systems, and 2)
resource allocation under distributional uncertainty. A novelty of this work is
that it extends DRO to online optimization problems subject to a
distributionally uncertain dynamical system constraint, handled via a
control-dependent ambiguity set that leads to online-tractable optimization
with probabilistic guarantees on regret bounds. Further, we introduce an online
version of Nesterov's accelerated-gradient algorithm, and analyze its
performance to solve this class of problems via dissipativity theory.

binary classification studies. However, real-life scenarios oftentimes share
complexities that prevent from the use of the as-is LR model, and instead
highlight the need to include high-order interactions to capture data
variability. This becomes even more challenging because of: (i) datasets
growing wider, with more and more variables; (ii) studies being typically
conducted in strongly imbalanced settings; (iii) samples going from very large
to extremely small; (iv) the need of providing both predictive models and
interpretable results. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Learning
high-order Interactions via targeted Pattern Search (LIPS), to select
interaction terms of varying order to include in a LR model for an imbalanced
binary classification task when input data are categorical. LIPS's rationale
stems from the duality between item sets and categorical interactions. The
algorithm relies on an interaction learning step based on a well-known frequent
item set mining algorithm, and a novel dissimilarity-based interaction
selection step that allows the user to specify the number of interactions to be
included in the LR model. In addition, we particularize two variants (Scores
LIPS and Clusters LIPS), that can address even more specific needs. Through a
set of experiments we validate our algorithm and prove its wide applicability
to real-life research scenarios, showing that it outperforms a benchmark
state-of-the-art algorithm.

  Approach Applied to Dynamic Reserves and Demand Forecasting",,,,,math.OC cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY stat.ME stat.ML,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Forecasting and decision-making are generally modeled as two sequential steps
with no feedback, following an open-loop approach. In this paper, we present
application-driven learning, a new closed-loop framework in which the processes
of forecasting and decision-making are merged and co-optimized through a
bilevel optimization problem. We present our methodology in a general format
and prove that the solution converges to the best estimator in terms of the
expected cost of the selected application. Then, we propose two solution
methods: an exact method based on the KKT conditions of the second-level
problem and a scalable heuristic approach suitable for decomposition methods.
The proposed methodology is applied to the relevant problem of defining dynamic
reserve requirements and conditional load forecasts, offering an alternative
approach to current ad hoc procedures implemented in industry practices. We
benchmark our methodology with the standard sequential least-squares forecast
and dispatch planning process. We apply the proposed methodology to an
illustrative system and to a wide range of instances, from dozens of buses to
large-scale realistic systems with thousands of buses. Our results show that

e-commerce and online advertisement-based applications. These models use
massive embedding tables to store numerical representation of items' and users'
categorical variables (memory intensive) and employ neural networks (compute
intensive) to generate final recommendations. Training these large-scale
recommendation models is evolving to require increasing data and compute
resources. The highly parallel neural networks portion of these models can
benefit from GPU acceleration however, large embedding tables often cannot fit
in the limited-capacity GPU device memory. Hence, this paper deep dives into
the semantics of training data and obtains insights about the feature access,
transfer, and usage patterns of these models. We observe that, due to the
popularity of certain inputs, the accesses to the embeddings are highly skewed
with a few embedding entries being accessed up to 10000x more. This paper
leverages this asymmetrical access pattern to offer a framework, called FAE,
and proposes a hot-embedding aware data layout for training recommender models.
This layout utilizes the scarce GPU memory for storing the highly accessed
embeddings, thus reduces the data transfers from CPU to GPU. At the same time,
FAE engages the GPU to accelerate the executions of these hot embedding
entries. Experiments on production-scale recommendation models with real
datasets show that FAE reduces the overall training time by 2.3x and 1.52x in
comparison to XDL CPU-only and XDL CPU-GPU execution while maintaining baseline
accuracy

regression tasks, including overparameterized settings where there are more
learned parameters than data samples. The target task learning is addressed by
using its training data together with the parameters previously computed for
the source task. We define a transfer learning approach to the target task as a
linear regression optimization with a regularization on the distance between
the to-be-learned target parameters and the already-learned source parameters.
We analytically characterize the generalization performance of our transfer
learning approach and demonstrate its ability to resolve the peak in
generalization errors in double descent phenomena of the minimum L2-norm
solution to linear regression. Moreover, we show that for sufficiently related
tasks, the optimally tuned transfer learning approach can outperform the
optimally tuned ridge regression method, even when the true parameter vector
conforms to an isotropic Gaussian prior distribution. Namely, we demonstrate
that transfer learning can beat the minimum mean square error (MMSE) solution
of the independent target task. Our results emphasize the ability of transfer
learning to extend the solution space to the target task and, by that, to have
an improved MMSE solution. We formulate the linear MMSE solution to our
transfer learning setting and point out its key differences from the common
design philosophy to transfer learning.

instant per sensor. Thus each sensor is characterized by a vectorial time
series. We would like to identify the dependency structure among these sensors
and represent it by a graph. When there is only one feature per sensor, the
vector auto-regressive models have been widely adapted to infer the structure
of Granger causality. The resulting graph is referred to as causal graph. Our
first contribution is then extending VAR models to matrix-variate models to

respectively in low and high dimensions, which can update quickly the estimates
of coefficients when new samples arrive. In particular in high dimensional

for the online learning. We also provide an adaptive tuning procedure for the
regularization parameter. Lastly, we consider that, the application of AR
models onto data usually requires detrending the raw data, however, this step
is forbidden in online context. Therefore, we augment the proposed AR models by
incorporating trend as extra parameter, and then adapt the online algorithms to
the augmented data models, which allow us to simultaneously learn the graph and
trend from streaming samples. In this work, we consider primarily the periodic
trend. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data are performed,

  Agents","35 pages, 9 figures",,,,q-bio.NC cs.AI cs.NE,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  There is much to learn through synthesis of Developmental Biology, Cognitive
Science and Computational Modeling. Our path forward involves a design for
developmentally-inspired learning agents based on Braitenberg Vehicles.
Continual developmental neurosimulation allows us to consider the role of
developmental trajectories in bridging the related phenomena of nervous system
morphogenesis, developmental learning, and plasticity. Being closely tied to
continual learning, our approach is tightly integrated with developmental
embodiment, and can be implemented using a type of agent called developmental
Braitenberg Vehicles (dBVs). dBVs begin their lives as a set of undefined
structures that transform into agent-based systems including a body, sensors,
effectors, and nervous system. This phenotype is characterized in terms of
developmental timing: with distinct morphogenetic, critical, and acquisition
(developmental learning) periods. We further propose that network morphogenesis
can be accomplished using a genetic algorithmic approach, while developmental
learning can be implemented using a number of computational methodologies. This
approach provides a framework for adaptive agent behavior that might result
from a developmental approach: namely by exploiting critical periods or growth
and acquisition, an explicitly embodied network architecture, and a distinction
between the assembly of neuronal networks and active learning on these
networks. In conclusion, we will consider agent learning and development at
different timescales, from very short (<100ms) intervals to long-term
evolution. The development, evolution, and learning in an embodied agent-based
approach is key to an integrative view of biologically-inspired intelligence.

problem in X-ray Computed Tomography (CT). It manifests as various artifacts in
the reconstruction, making its abatement or correction critical for image
quality. Despite success in specific settings, hardware-based methods require
modification in the hardware, or increase in the scan time or dose. This
accounts for the great interest in software-based methods, including
Monte-Carlo based scatter estimation, analytical-numerical, and kernel-based
methods, with data-driven learning-based approaches demonstrated recently. In
this work, two novel physics-inspired deep-learning-based methods, PhILSCAT and
OV-PhILSCAT, are proposed. The methods estimate and correct for the scatter in
the acquired projection measurements. Different from previous works, they
incorporate both an initial reconstruction of the object of interest and the
scatter-corrupted measurements related to it, and use a deep neural network
architecture and cost function, both specifically tailored to the problem.
Numerical experiments with data generated by Monte-Carlo simulations of the
imaging of phantoms reveal consistent improvement over a recent purely
projection-domain deep neural network scatter correction method.

can solve on a fixed data with exactly zero or at most a given number of
cross-validation errors? While the number in the former case is known to be
limited by the no-free-lunch theorem, we show that the exact answers are given
by the theory of error detecting codes. As a case study, we focus on the AUC
performance measure and leave-pair-out cross-validation (LPOCV), in which every
possible pair of data with different class labels is held out at a time. We
show that the maximal number of classification problems with fixed class
proportion, for which a learning algorithm can achieve zero LPOCV error, equals
the maximal number of code words in a constant weight code (CWC), with certain
technical properties. We then generalize CWCs by introducing light CWCs, and
prove an analogous result for nonzero LPOCV errors and light CWCs. Moreover, we
prove both upper and lower bounds on the maximal numbers of code words in light
CWCs. Finally, as an immediate practical application, we develop new LPOCV
based randomization tests for learning algorithms that generalize the classical
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test.

delivering aggressive and robust performance in many challenging control tasks,
coping with nonlinear system dynamics, constraints, and observational noise.
Despite their success, these methods often rely on simple control
distributions, which can limit their performance in highly uncertain and
complex environments. MPC frameworks must be able to accommodate changing
distributions over system parameters, based on the most recent measurements. In
this paper, we devise an implicit variational inference algorithm able to
estimate distributions over model parameters and control inputs on-the-fly. The
method incorporates Stein Variational gradient descent to approximate the
target distributions as a collection of particles, and performs updates based
on a Bayesian formulation. This enables the approximation of complex
multi-modal posterior distributions, typically occurring in challenging and
realistic robot navigation tasks. We demonstrate our approach on both simulated
and real-world experiments requiring real-time execution in the face of
dynamically changing environments.

  The widespread adoption of nonlinear Receding Horizon Control (RHC)
strategies by industry has led to more than 30 years of intense research
efforts to provide stability guarantees for these methods. However, current
theoretical guarantees require that each (generally nonconvex) planning problem
can be solved to (approximate) global optimality, which is an unrealistic
requirement for the derivative-based local optimization methods generally used
in practical implementations of RHC. This paper takes the first step towards
understanding stability guarantees for nonlinear RHC when the inner planning
problem is solved to first-order stationary points, but not necessarily global
optima. Special attention is given to feedback linearizable systems, and a
mixture of positive and negative results are provided. We establish that, under
certain strong conditions, first-order solutions to RHC exponentially stabilize
linearizable systems. Surprisingly, these conditions can hold even in
situations where there may be \textit{spurious local minima.} Crucially, this
guarantee requires that state costs applied to the planning problems are in a
certain sense `compatible' with the global geometry of the system, and a simple
counter-example demonstrates the necessity of this condition. These results
highlight the need to rethink the role of global geometry in the context of
optimization-based control.

2104.0017,Robik Shrestha,"Robik Shrestha, Kushal Kafle and Christopher Kanan",Are Bias Mitigation Techniques for Deep Learning Effective?,"Published in WACV 2022 under the title ""An Investigation of Critical
  Issues in Bias Mitigation Techniques""",,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  A critical problem in deep learning is that systems learn inappropriate
biases, resulting in their inability to perform well on minority groups. This
has led to the creation of multiple algorithms that endeavor to mitigate bias.
However, it is not clear how effective these methods are. This is because study
protocols differ among papers, systems are tested on datasets that fail to test
many forms of bias, and systems have access to hidden knowledge or are tuned
specifically to the test set. To address this, we introduce an improved
evaluation protocol, sensible metrics, and a new dataset, which enables us to
ask and answer critical questions about bias mitigation algorithms. We evaluate
seven state-of-the-art algorithms using the same network architecture and
hyperparameter selection policy across three benchmark datasets. We introduce a
new dataset called Biased MNIST that enables assessment of robustness to
multiple bias sources. We use Biased MNIST and a visual question answering
(VQA) benchmark to assess robustness to hidden biases. Rather than only tuning
to the test set distribution, we study robustness across different tuning
distributions, which is critical because for many applications the test
distribution may not be known during development. We find that algorithms
exploit hidden biases, are unable to scale to multiple forms of bias, and are
highly sensitive to the choice of tuning set. Based on our findings, we implore
the community to adopt more rigorous assessment of future bias mitigation
methods. All data, code, and results are publicly available at:

unsupervised learning method for real-time analysis of streaming spectral data
in time-sensitive data collection, such as $\textit{in situ}$ characterization
of materials. However, canonical NMF methods are optimized to reconstruct a
full dataset as closely as possible, with no underlying requirement that the
reconstruction produces components or weights representative of the true
physical processes. In this work, we demonstrate how constraining NMF weights
or components, provided as known or assumed priors, can provide significant
improvement in revealing true underlying phenomena. We present a PyTorch based
method for efficiently applying constrained NMF and demonstrate this on several
synthetic examples. When applied to streaming experimentally measured spectral
data, an expert researcher-in-the-loop can provide and dynamically adjust the
constraints. This set of interactive priors to the NMF model can, for example,
contain known or identified independent components, as well as functional
expectations about the mixing of components. We demonstrate this application on
measured X-ray diffraction and pair distribution function data from $\textit{in
situ}$ beamline experiments. Details of the method are described, and general
guidance provided to employ constrained NMF in extraction of critical
information and insights during $\textit{in situ}$ and high-throughput

experiences of the world. Artificial neural networks come nowhere close to this
ability. When tasked with learning to classify objects by training on
non-repeating video frames in temporal order (online stream learning), models
that learn well from shuffled datasets catastrophically forget old knowledge
upon learning new stimuli. We propose a new continual learning algorithm,
Compositional Replay Using Memory Blocks (CRUMB), which mitigates forgetting by
replaying feature maps reconstructed by combining generic parts. CRUMB
concatenates trainable and re-usable ""memory block"" vectors to compositionally
reconstruct feature map tensors in convolutional neural networks. Storing the
indices of memory blocks used to reconstruct new stimuli enables memories of
the stimuli to be replayed during later tasks. This reconstruction mechanism
also primes the neural network to minimize catastrophic forgetting by biasing
it towards attending to information about object shapes more than information
about image textures, and stabilizes the network during stream learning by
providing a shared feature-level basis for all training examples. These
properties allow CRUMB to outperform an otherwise identical algorithm that
stores and replays raw images, while occupying only 3.6% as much memory. We
stress-tested CRUMB alongside 13 competing methods on 7 challenging datasets.
To address the limited number of existing online stream learning datasets, we
introduce 2 new benchmarks by adapting existing datasets for stream learning.
With only 3.7-4.1% as much memory and 15-43% as much runtime, CRUMB mitigates
catastrophic forgetting more effectively than the state-of-the-art. Our code is
available at https://github.com/MorganBDT/crumb.git.

  Theoretical Guarantees with Empirical Performance",,,,,stat.ML cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Missing data is a common issue in real-world datasets. This paper studies the
performance of impute-then-regress pipelines by contrasting theoretical and
empirical evidence. We establish the asymptotic consistency of such pipelines
for a broad family of imputation methods. While common sense suggests that a
`good' imputation method produces datasets that are plausible, we show, on the
contrary, that, as far as prediction is concerned, crude can be good. Among
others, we find that mode-impute is asymptotically sub-optimal, while
mean-impute is asymptotically optimal. We then exhaustively assess the validity
of these theoretical conclusions on a large corpus of synthetic, semi-real, and
real datasets. While the empirical evidence we collect mostly supports our
theoretical findings, it also highlights gaps between theory and practice and
opportunities for future research, regarding the relevance of the MAR
assumption, the complex interdependency between the imputation and regression
tasks, and the need for realistic synthetic data generation models.

monitoring the social distancing in crowded public places is of grate
importance to prevent a new massive wave of COVID-19 infections. Recent works
in that matter have limited themselves by detecting social distancing in
corridors up to small crowds by detecting each person individually considering
the full body in the image. In this work, we propose a new framework for
monitoring the social-distance using end-to-end Deep Learning, to detect crowds
violating the social-distance in wide areas where important occlusions may be
present. Our framework consists in the creation of a new ground truth based on
the ground truth density maps and the proposal of two different solutions, a
density-map-based and a segmentation-based, to detect the crowds violating the
social-distance constrain. We assess the results of both approaches by using
the generated ground truth from the PET2009 and CityStreet datasets. We show
that our framework performs well at providing the zones where people are not
following the social-distance even when heavily occluded or far away from one
camera.

development, software log anomaly detection is becoming increasingly important.
Prior works mainly follow a traditional four-staged architecture (Preprocessor,
Parser, Vectorizer, and Classifier). This paper proposes OneLog, which utilizes
a single Deep Neural Network (DNN) instead of multiple separate components.
OneLog harnesses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) at the character level to
take digits, numbers, and punctuations, which were removed in prior works, into
account alongside the main natural language text. We evaluate our approach in
six message- and sequence-based data sets: HDFS, Hadoop, BGL, Thunderbird,
Spirit, and Liberty. We experiment with Onelog with single-, multi-, and
cross-project setups. Onelog offers state-of-the-art performance in our
datasets. Onelog can utilize multi-project datasets simultaneously during
training, which suggests our model can generalize between datasets.
Multi-project training also improves Onelog performance making it ideal when
limited training data is available for an individual project. We also found
that cross-project anomaly detection is possible with a single project pair
(Liberty and Spirit). Analysis of model internals shows that one log has
multiple modes of detecting anomalies and that the model learns manually
validated parsing rules for the log messages. We conclude that character-based
CNNs are a promising approach toward end-to-end learning in log anomaly
detection. They offer good performance and generalization over multiple
datasets. We will make our scripts publicly available upon the acceptance of
this paper.

tool for the prevention and mitigation of cyber attacks. A number of labelled
synthetic datasets generated have been generated and made publicly available by
researchers, and they have become the benchmarks via which new ML-based NIDS
classifiers are being evaluated. Recently published results show excellent
classification performance with these datasets, increasingly approaching 100
percent performance across key evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1 score,
etc. Unfortunately, we have not yet seen these excellent academic research
results translated into practical NIDS systems with such near-perfect
performance. This motivated our research presented in this paper, where we
analyse the statistical properties of the benign traffic in three of the more
recent and relevant NIDS datasets, (CIC, UNSW, ...). As a comparison, we
consider two datasets obtained from real-world production networks, one from a
university network and one from a medium size Internet Service Provider (ISP).
Our results show that the two real-world datasets are quite similar among
themselves in regards to most of the considered statistical features. Equally,
the three synthetic datasets are also relatively similar within their group.
However, and most importantly, our results show a distinct difference of most
of the considered statistical features between the three synthetic datasets and
the two real-world datasets. Since ML relies on the basic assumption of
training and test datasets being sampled from the same distribution, this
raises the question of how well the performance results of ML-classifiers
trained on the considered synthetic datasets can translate and generalise to
real-world networks. We believe this is an interesting and relevant question
which provides motivation for further research in this space.

  Birbil","Rule Generation for Classification: Scalability, Interpretability, and
  Fairness",,,,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We introduce a new rule-based optimization method for classification with
constraints. The proposed method leverages column generation for linear
programming, and hence, is scalable to large datasets. The resulting pricing
subproblem is shown to be NP-Hard. We recourse to a decision tree-based
heuristic and solve a proxy pricing subproblem for acceleration. The method
returns a set of rules along with their optimal weights indicating the
importance of each rule for learning. We address interpretability and fairness
by assigning cost coefficients to the rules and introducing additional
constraints. In particular, we focus on local interpretability and generalize
separation criterion in fairness to multiple sensitive attributes and classes.
We test the performance of the proposed methodology on a collection of datasets
and present a case study to elaborate on its different aspects. The proposed
rule-based learning method exhibits a good compromise between local
interpretability and fairness on the one side, and accuracy on the other side.

principle for damage identification. As part of SHM, the propagation of
ultrasonic guided waves (UGWs) is tracked and analyzed for the changes in the
associated wave pattern. These changes help identify the location of a
structural damage, if any. We advance existing research by accounting for
uncertainty in the material and geometric properties of a structure. The
physics model used in this study comprises of a monolithically coupled system
of acoustic and elastic wave equations, known as the wave propagation in
fluid-solid and their interface (WpFSI) problem. As the UGWs propagate in the
solid, fluid, and their interface, the wave signal displacement measurements
are contrasted against the benchmark pattern. For the numerical solution, we
develop an efficient algorithm that successfully addresses the inherent
complexity of solving the multiphysics problem under uncertainty. We present a
procedure that uses Gaussian process regression and convolutional neural
network for predicting the UGW propagation in a solid-fluid and their interface
under uncertainty. First, a set of training images for different realizations
of the uncertain parameters of the inclusion inside the structure is generated
using a monolithically-coupled system of acoustic and elastic wave equations.
Next, Gaussian processes trained with these images are used for predicting the
propagated wave with convolutional neural networks for further enhancement to
produce high-quality images of the wave patterns for new realizations of the
uncertainty. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides an
accurate prediction for the WpFSI problem in the presence of uncertainty.

infinitely many linear processes, through the so-called Koopman mode
decomposition. Its data-driven approximation- Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)-
has been extensively developed and deployed across a plethora of fields. In
this work, we study the effect of subtracting the temporal mean on the DMD
approximation, for observables possessing only a finite number of Koopman
modes.
  Pre-processing time-sequential training data by removing the temporal mean
has been a point of contention in the Companion matrix formulation of DMD. This
stems from the potential of said pre-processing to render DMD equivalent to a
temporal Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). We prove that this equivalence is
impossible when the training data is linearly consistent and the order of the
DMD approximation exceeds the number of Koopman modes. Since model order and
training set size are synonymous in this variant of DMD, the parity of DMD and
DFT can, therefore, be indicative of inadequate training data.

question of whether, for a given class of hypotheses, it is possible to
efficiently find a {consistent} hypothesis, i.e., which has zero training
error. While problems involving {\em convex} hypotheses have been extensively
studied, the question of whether efficient learning is possible for non-convex
hypotheses composed of possibly several disconnected regions is still less
understood. Although it has been shown quite a while ago that efficient
learning of weakly convex hypotheses, a parameterized relaxation of convex
hypotheses, is possible for the special case of Boolean functions, the question
of whether this idea can be developed into a generic paradigm has not been
studied yet. In this paper, we provide a positive answer and show that the
consistent hypothesis finding problem can indeed be solved in polynomial time
for a broad class of weakly convex hypotheses over metric spaces. To this end,
we propose a general domain-independent algorithm for finding consistent weakly
convex hypotheses and prove sufficient conditions for its efficiency that
characterize the corresponding hypothesis classes. To illustrate our general
algorithm and its properties, we discuss several non-trivial learning examples
to demonstrate how it can be used to efficiently solve the corresponding
consistent hypothesis finding problem. Without the weak convexity constraint,
these problems are known to be computationally intractable. We then proceed to
show that the general idea of our algorithm can even be extended to the case of
extensional weakly convex hypotheses, as it naturally arise, e.g., when
performing vertex classification in graphs. We prove that using our extended
algorithm, the problem can be solved in polynomial time provided the distances
in the domain can be computed efficiently.

benthic (seafloor) surveys, where the vehicle collects optical imagery of the
seafloor. Due to the small-sensor footprint of the cameras and the vast areas
to be surveyed, these AUVs can not feasibly collect full coverage imagery of
areas larger than a few tens of thousands of square meters. Therefore it is
necessary for AUV paths to sample the surveys areas sparsely, yet effectively.
Broad-scale acoustic bathymetric data is readily available over large areas,
and is often a useful prior of seafloor cover. As such, prior bathymetry can be
used to guide AUV data collection. This research proposes methods for planning
initial AUV surveys that efficiently explore a feature space representation of
the bathymetry, in order to sample from a diverse set of bathymetric terrain.
This will enable the AUV to visit areas that likely contain unique habitats and
are representative of the entire survey site. We propose several information
gathering planners that utilise a feature space exploration reward, to plan
freeform paths or to optimise the placement of a survey template. The
suitability of these methods to plan AUV surveys is evaluated based on the
coverage of the feature space and also the ability to visit all classes of
benthic habitat on the initial dive. Informative planners based on
Rapidly-expanding Random Trees (RRT) and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) were
found to be the most effective. This is a valuable tool for AUV surveys as it
increases the utility of initial dives. It also delivers a comprehensive
training set to learn a relationship between acoustic bathymetry and
visually-derived seafloor classifications.

automated driving. This task is challenging because the behavior of pedestrians
is influenced by both their own history paths and the interactions with others.
Previous research modeled these interactions with pooling mechanisms or
aggregating with hand-crafted attention weights. In this paper, we present the
Social Interaction-Weighted Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Neural Network
(Social-IWSTCNN), which includes both the spatial and the temporal features. We
propose a novel design, namely the Social Interaction Extractor, to learn the
spatial and social interaction features of pedestrians. Most previous works
used ETH and UCY datasets which include five scenes but do not cover urban
traffic scenarios extensively for training and evaluation. In this paper, we
use the recently released large-scale Waymo Open Dataset in urban traffic
scenarios, which includes 374 urban training scenes and 76 urban testing scenes
to analyze the performance of our proposed algorithm in comparison to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The results show that our algorithm outperforms
SOTA algorithms such as Social-LSTM, Social-GAN, and Social-STGCNN on both
Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE).
Furthermore, our Social-IWSTCNN is 54.8 times faster in data pre-processing
speed, and 4.7 times faster in total test speed than the current best SOTA
algorithm Social-STGCNN.

  Estimation for AI-Based Robotic Projectile Launch Modeling",not relevant work,,,,cs.RO cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Modeling of non-rigid object launching and manipulation is complex
considering the wide range of dynamics affecting trajectory, many of which may
be unknown. Using physics models can be inaccurate because they cannot account
for unknown factors and the effects of the deformation of the object as it is
launched; moreover, deriving force coefficients for these models is not
possible without extensive experimental testing. Recently, advancements in
data-powered artificial intelligence methods have allowed learnable models and
systems to emerge. It is desirable to train a model for launch prediction on a
robot, as deep neural networks can account for immeasurable dynamics. However,
the inability to collect large amounts of experimental data decreases
performance of deep neural networks. Through estimating force coefficients, the
accepted physics models can be leveraged to produce adequate supplemental data
to artificially increase the size of the training set, yielding improved neural
networks. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for algorithmic
estimation of force coefficients for non-rigid object launching, which can be
generalized to other domains, in order to generate large datasets. We implement
a novel training algorithm and objective for our deep neural network to
accurately model launch trajectory of non-rigid objects and predict whether
they will hit a series of targets. Our experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of using simulated data from force coefficient estimation and
shows the importance of simulated data for training an effective neural
network.

problem in private optimization. While the theory of DP-ERM is well-studied, as
large-scale models become prevalent, traditional DP-ERM methods face new
challenges, including (1) the prohibitive dependence on the ambient dimension,
(2) the highly non-smooth objective functions, (3) costly first-order gradient
oracles. Such challenges demand rethinking existing DP-ERM methodologies. In
this work, we show that the regularized exponential mechanism combined with
existing samplers can address these challenges altogether: under the standard
unconstrained domain and low-rank gradients assumptions, our algorithm can
achieve rank-dependent risk bounds for non-smooth convex objectives using only
zeroth order oracles, which was not accomplished by prior methods. This
highlights the power of sampling in differential privacy. We further construct
lower bounds, demonstrating that when gradients are full-rank, there is no
separation between the constrained and unconstrained settings. Our lower bound
is derived from a general black-box reduction from unconstrained to the
constrained domain and an improved lower bound in the constrained setting,
which might be of independent interest.

services by automatically analyzing substantial amounts of student behavioral
data. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is one of the fundamental tasks for student
behavioral data analysis, aiming to monitor students' evolving knowledge state
during their problem-solving process. In recent years, a substantial number of
studies have concentrated on this rapidly growing field, significantly
contributing to its advancements. In this survey, we will conduct a thorough
investigation of these progressions. Firstly, we present three types of
fundamental KT models with distinct technical routes. Subsequently, we review
extensive variants of the fundamental KT models that consider more stringent
learning assumptions. Moreover, the development of KT cannot be separated from
its applications, thereby we present typical KT applications in various
scenarios. To facilitate the work of researchers and practitioners in this
field, we have developed two open-source algorithm libraries: EduData that
enables the download and preprocessing of KT-related datasets, and EduKTM that
provides an extensible and unified implementation of existing mainstream KT
models. Finally, we discuss potential directions for future research in this
rapidly growing field. We hope that the current survey will assist both
researchers and practitioners in fostering the development of KT, thereby
benefiting a broader range of students.

rationality, the most likely outcomes are given by an equilibrium (e.g. a Nash
equilibrium). In many practical settings, games are influenced by context, i.e.
additional data beyond the control of any agent (e.g. weather for traffic and
fiscal policy for market economies). Often the exact game mechanics are
unknown, yet vast amounts of historical data consisting of (context,
equilibrium) pairs are available, raising the possibility of learning a solver
which predicts the equilibria given only the context. We introduce Nash Fixed
Point Networks (N-FPNs), a class of neural networks that naturally output
equilibria. Crucially, N- FPNs employ a constraint decoupling scheme to handle
complicated agent action sets while avoiding expensive projections.
Empirically, we find N-FPNs are compatible with the recently developed
Jacobian-Free Backpropagation technique for training implicit networks, making
them significantly faster and easier to train than prior models. Our
experiments show N-FPNs are capable of scaling to problems orders of magnitude
larger than existing learned game solvers.

  Prediction",This is accepted at the Applied Physics Reviews journal,,10.1063/5.0047066,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The adoption of machine learning in materials science has rapidly transformed
materials property prediction. Hurdles limiting full capitalization of recent
advancements in machine learning include the limited development of methods to
learn the underlying interactions of multiple elements, as well as the
relationships among multiple properties, to facilitate property prediction in
new composition spaces. To address these issues, we introduce the Hierarchical
Correlation Learning for Multi-property Prediction (H-CLMP) framework that
seamlessly integrates (i) prediction using only a material's composition, (ii)
learning and exploitation of correlations among target properties in
multi-target regression, and (iii) leveraging training data from tangential
domains via generative transfer learning. The model is demonstrated for
prediction of spectral optical absorption of complex metal oxides spanning 69
3-cation metal oxide composition spaces. H-CLMP accurately predicts non-linear
composition-property relationships in composition spaces for which no training
data is available, which broadens the purview of machine learning to the
discovery of materials with exceptional properties. This achievement results
from the principled integration of latent embedding learning, property
correlation learning, generative transfer learning, and attention models. The
best performance is obtained using H-CLMP with Transfer learning (H-CLMP(T))
wherein a generative adversarial network is trained on computational density of
states data and deployed in the target domain to augment prediction of optical
absorption from composition. H-CLMP(T) aggregates multiple knowledge sources
with a framework that is well-suited for multi-target regression across the
physical sciences.

structure and function, although recent evidence has led some to question the
extent of both types of modularity. We used artificial neural networks to test
the hypothesis that structural modularity is sufficient to guarantee functional
specialization, and find that in general, this doesn't necessarily hold. We
then systematically tested which features of the environment and network do
lead to the emergence of specialization. We used a simple toy environment, task
and network, allowing us precise control, and show that in this setup, several
distinct measures of specialization give qualitatively similar results. We
further find that in this setup (1) specialization can only emerge in
environments where features of that environment are meaningfully separable, (2)
specialization preferentially emerges when the network is strongly
resource-constrained, and (3) these findings are qualitatively similar across
the different variations of network architectures that we tested, but that the
quantitative relationships depend on the precise architecture. Finally, we show
that functional specialization varies dynamically across time, and demonstrate
that these dynamics depend on both the timing and bandwidth of information flow
in the network. We conclude that a static notion of specialization, based on
structural modularity, is likely too simple a framework for understanding
intelligence in situations of real-world complexity, from biology to
brain-inspired neuromorphic systems. We propose that thoroughly stress testing
candidate definitions of functional modularity in simplified scenarios before
extending to more complex data, network models and electrophysiological
recordings is likely to be a fruitful approach.

  (ICLR) 2022",cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This paper argues that continual learning methods can benefit by splitting
the capacity of the learner across multiple models. We use statistical learning
theory and experimental analysis to show how multiple tasks can interact with
each other in a non-trivial fashion when a single model is trained on them. The
generalization error on a particular task can improve when it is trained with
synergistic tasks, but can also deteriorate when trained with competing tasks.
This theory motivates our method named Model Zoo which, inspired from the
boosting literature, grows an ensemble of small models, each of which is
trained during one episode of continual learning. We demonstrate that Model Zoo
obtains large gains in accuracy on a variety of continual learning benchmark
problems. Code is available at

estimates increases. There are currently two main approaches to test the

by evaluating their loglikelihood on a test set. Other methods output a
prediction interval directly. These methods are often tested by examining the
fraction of test points that fall inside the corresponding prediction
intervals. Intuitively both approaches seem logical. However, we demonstrate
through both theoretical arguments and simulations that both ways of evaluating
the quality of uncertainty estimates have serious flaws. Firstly, both
approaches cannot disentangle the separate components that jointly create the
predictive uncertainty, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of the
estimates of these components. Secondly, a better loglikelihood does not
guarantee better prediction intervals, which is what the methods are often used
for in practice. Moreover, the current approach to test prediction intervals
directly has additional flaws. We show why it is fundamentally flawed to test a
prediction or confidence interval on a single test set. At best, marginal
coverage is measured, implicitly averaging out overconfident and underconfident
predictions. A much more desirable property is pointwise coverage, requiring
the correct coverage for each prediction. We demonstrate through practical
examples that these effects can result in favoring a method, based on the
predictive uncertainty, that has undesirable behaviour of the confidence or
prediction intervals. Finally, we propose a simulation-based testing approach
that addresses these problems while still allowing easy comparison between
different methods.

  Expensive Black-box Functions",33 pages,,10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110744,,cs.LG cs.NE math.OC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Surrogate algorithms such as Bayesian optimisation are especially designed
for black-box optimisation problems with expensive objectives, such as
hyperparameter tuning or simulation-based optimisation. In the literature,
these algorithms are usually evaluated with synthetic benchmarks which are well
established but have no expensive objective, and only on one or two real-life
applications which vary wildly between papers. There is a clear lack of
standardisation when it comes to benchmarking surrogate algorithms on
real-life, expensive, black-box objective functions. This makes it very
difficult to draw conclusions on the effect of algorithmic contributions and to
give substantial advice on which method to use when. A new benchmark library,
EXPObench, provides first steps towards such a standardisation. The library is
used to provide an extensive comparison of six different surrogate algorithms
on four expensive optimisation problems from different real-life applications.
This has led to new insights regarding the relative importance of exploration,
the evaluation time of the objective, and the used model. We also provide rules
of thumb for which surrogate algorithm to use in which situation. A further
contribution is that we make the algorithms and benchmark problem instances
publicly available, contributing to more uniform analysis of surrogate
algorithms. Most importantly, we include the performance of the six algorithms
on all evaluated problem instances. This results in a unique new dataset that
lowers the bar for researching new methods as the number of expensive
evaluations required for comparison is significantly reduced.

samples using a model that is trained on normal data. With recent advancements
in deep learning, researchers have designed efficient deep anomaly detection
methods. Existing works commonly use neural networks to map the data into a
more informative representation and then apply an anomaly detection algorithm.
In this paper, we propose a method, DASVDD, that jointly learns the parameters
of an autoencoder while minimizing the volume of an enclosing hyper-sphere on
its latent representation. We propose an anomaly score which is a combination
of autoencoder's reconstruction error and the distance from the center of the
enclosing hypersphere in the latent representation. Minimizing this anomaly
score aids us in learning the underlying distribution of the normal class
during training. Including the reconstruction error in the anomaly score
ensures that DASVDD does not suffer from the common hypersphere collapse issue
since the DASVDD model does not converge to the trivial solution of mapping all
inputs to a constant point in the latent representation. Experimental
evaluations on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method
outperforms the commonly used state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms
while maintaining robust performance across different anomaly classes.

located data has deepened interest in using them for various policy
interventions, through computational data analysis tasks such as spatial hot
spot detection. In this paper, we consider, for the first time to our best
knowledge, fairness in detecting spatial hot spots. We motivate the need for
ensuring fairness through statistical parity over the collective population
covered across chosen hot spots. We then characterize the task of identifying a
diverse set of solutions in the noteworthiness-fairness trade-off spectrum, to
empower the user to choose a trade-off justified by the policy domain. Being a
novel task formulation, we also develop a suite of evaluation metrics for fair
hot spots, motivated by the need to evaluate pertinent aspects of the task. We
illustrate the computational infeasibility of identifying fair hot spots using
naive and/or direct approaches and devise a method, codenamed {\it FiSH}, for
efficiently identifying high-quality, fair and diverse sets of spatial hot
spots. FiSH traverses the tree-structured search space using heuristics that
guide it towards identifying effective and fair sets of spatial hot spots.
Through an extensive empirical analysis over a real-world dataset from the
domain of human development, we illustrate that FiSH generates high-quality
solutions at fast response times.

facilities. Recent advances in video analytics for patient monitoring provide a
non-intrusive avenue to reduce this risk through continuous activity
monitoring. However, in-bed fall risk assessment systems have received less
attention in the literature. The majority of prior studies have focused on fall
event detection, and do not consider the circumstances that may indicate an
imminent inpatient fall. Here, we propose a video-based system that can monitor
the risk of a patient falling, and alert staff of unsafe behaviour to help
prevent falls before they occur. We propose an approach that leverages recent
advances in human localisation and skeleton pose estimation to extract spatial
features from video frames recorded in a simulated environment. We demonstrate
that body positions can be effectively recognised and provide useful evidence
for fall risk assessment. This work highlights the benefits of video-based
models for analysing behaviours of interest, and demonstrates how such a system
could enable sufficient lead time for healthcare professionals to respond and

segmentation, clustering, alpha-shape or defining a region in nD-space.
However, the machine learning literature lacks methods for generating connected
decision boundaries using neural networks. Thresholding an invex function, a
generalization of a convex function, generates such decision boundaries. This
paper presents two methods for constructing invex functions using neural
networks. The first approach is based on constraining a neural network with
Gradient Clipped-Gradient Penality (GCGP), where we clip and penalise the
gradients. In contrast, the second one is based on the relationship of the
invex function to the composition of invertible and convex functions. We employ
connectedness as a basic interpretation method and create connected
region-based classifiers. We show that multiple connected set based classifiers
can approximate any classification function. In the experiments section, we use
our methods for classification tasks using an ensemble of 1-vs-all models as
well as using a single multiclass model on small-scale datasets. The
experiments show that connected set-based classifiers do not pose any
disadvantage over ordinary neural network classifiers, but rather, enhance
their interpretability. We also did an extensive study on the properties of
invex function and connected sets for interpretability and network morphism
with experiments on toy and real-world data sets. Our study suggests that invex
function is fundamental to understanding and applying locality and
connectedness of input space which is useful for various downstream tasks.

molecular dynamics by multiple orders of magnitude and thus revolutionize
chemical simulations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently shown great
successes for this task, overtaking classical methods based on fixed molecular
kernels. However, they still appear very limited from a theoretical
perspective, since regular GNNs cannot distinguish certain types of graphs. In
this work we close this gap between theory and practice. We show that GNNs with
spherical representations are indeed universal approximators for predictions
that are invariant to translation, and equivariant to permutation and rotation.
We then discretize such GNNs via directed edge embeddings and two-hop message
passing, and incorporate multiple structural improvements to arrive at the
geometric message passing neural network (GemNet). We demonstrate the benefits
of the proposed changes in multiple ablation studies. GemNet outperforms
previous models on the COLL, MD17, and OC20 datasets by 34%, 41%, and 20%,
respectively, and performs especially well on the most challenging molecules.
Our implementation is available online.

  data analysis","15 pages, 11 figures",,,,stat.ME astro-ph.IM physics.data-an,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis (MESA) method, developed by Burg,
offers a powerful tool for spectral estimation of a time-series. It relies on
Jaynes' maximum entropy principle, allowing the spectrum of a stochastic
process to be inferred using the coefficients of an autoregressive process
AR($p$) of order $p$. A closed-form recursive solution provides estimates for
both the autoregressive coefficients and the order $p$ of the process. We
provide a ready-to-use implementation of this algorithm in a Python package
called \texttt{memspectrum}, characterized through power spectral density (PSD)
analysis on synthetic data with known PSD and comparisons of different criteria
for stopping the recursion. Additionally, we compare the performance of our
implementation with the ubiquitous Welch algorithm, using synthetic data
generated from the GW150914 strain spectrum released by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra
collaboration. Our findings indicate that Burg's method provides PSD estimates
with systematically lower variance and bias. This is particularly manifest in
the case of a small (O($5000$)) number of data points, making Burg's method
most suitable to work in this regime. Since this is close to the typical length
of analysed gravitational waves data, improving the estimate of the PSD in this
regime leads to more reliable posterior profiles for the system under study. We
conclude our investigation by utilising MESA, and its particularly easy
parametrisation where the only free parameter is the order $p$ of the AR
process, to marginalise over the interferometers noise PSD in conjunction with
inferring the parameters of GW150914.

predict how good the performance is when transferring a source model (or source
task) to a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been
widely used for source model selection and multi-task learning. A major
challenge is how to make transfereability estimation robust under the
cross-domain cross-task settings. The recently proposed OTCE score solves this
problem by considering both domain and task differences, with the help of
transfer experiences on auxiliary tasks, which causes an efficiency overhead.
In this work, we propose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score
that dramatically improves the robustness of the task difference estimation in
OTCE, thus removing the need for auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we build the
joint correspondences between source and target data via solving an optimal
transport problem with a ground cost considering both the sample distance and
label distance, and then compute the transferability score as the negative
conditional entropy of the matched labels. Extensive validations under the
intra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE
score outperforms the auxiliary-task free version of OTCE for 7% and 12%,
respectively, and is also more robust than other existing transferability
metrics on average.

2106.10761,Moshe Shenfeld,Moshe Shenfeld and Katrina Ligett,Generalization in the Face of Adaptivity: A Bayesian Perspective,,"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36 (2024)",,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Repeated use of a data sample via adaptively chosen queries can rapidly lead
to overfitting, wherein the empirical evaluation of queries on the sample
significantly deviates from their mean with respect to the underlying data
distribution. It turns out that simple noise addition algorithms suffice to
prevent this issue, and differential privacy-based analysis of these algorithms
shows that they can handle an asymptotically optimal number of queries.
However, differential privacy's worst-case nature entails scaling such noise to
the range of the queries even for highly-concentrated queries, or introducing
more complex algorithms.
  In this paper, we prove that straightforward noise-addition algorithms
already provide variance-dependent guarantees that also extend to unbounded
queries. This improvement stems from a novel characterization that illuminates
the core problem of adaptive data analysis. We show that the harm of adaptivity
results from the covariance between the new query and a Bayes factor-based
measure of how much information about the data sample was encoded in the

interaction is undergoing intense study through dedicated scientific and
industrial research. The latest contributions in the field, including deep
learning approaches like recurrent neural networks, the potential of
context-aware strategies and user-centred design approaches, have brought back
the attention of the community to software-based dialogue systems, generally
known as conversational agents or chatbots. Nonetheless, and given the novelty
of the field, a generic, context-independent overview on the current state of
research of conversational agents covering all research perspectives involved
is missing. Motivated by this context, this paper reports a survey of the
current state of research of conversational agents through a systematic
literature review of secondary studies. The conducted research is designed to
develop an exhaustive perspective through a clear presentation of the
aggregated knowledge published by recent literature within a variety of
domains, research focuses and contexts. As a result, this research proposes a
holistic taxonomy of the different dimensions involved in the conversational
agents' field, which is expected to help researchers and to lay the groundwork
for future research in the field of natural language interfaces.

powerful tool to determine the molecular structure and function of unknown
samples (such as COVID-19 viral proteins). XFEL experiments are a challenge to
computing in two ways: i) due to the high cost of running XFELs, a fast
turnaround time from data acquisition to data analysis is essential to make
informed decisions on experimental protocols; ii) data collection rates are
growing exponentially, requiring new scalable algorithms. Here we report our
experiences analyzing data from two experiments at the Linac Coherent Light
Source (LCLS) during September 2020. Raw data were analyzed on NERSC's Cori
XC40 system, using the Superfacility paradigm: our workflow automatically moves
raw data between LCLS and NERSC, where it is analyzed using the software
package CCTBX. We achieved real time data analysis with a turnaround time from
data acquisition to full molecular reconstruction in as little as 10 min --
sufficient time for the experiment's operators to make informed decisions. By
hosting the data analysis on Cori, and by automating LCLS-NERSC
interoperability, we achieved a data analysis rate which matches the data
acquisition rate. Completing data analysis with 10 mins is a first for XFEL
experiments and an important milestone if we are to keep up with data
collection trends.

  intermediate representations that were added to the supplementary",,,,cs.LG cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In class-incremental learning, an agent with limited resources needs to learn
a sequence of classification tasks, forming an ever growing classification
problem, with the constraint of not being able to access data from previous
tasks. The main difference with task-incremental learning, where a task-ID is
available at inference time, is that the learner also needs to perform
cross-task discrimination, i.e. distinguish between classes that have not been
seen together. Approaches to tackle this problem are numerous and mostly make
use of an external memory (buffer) of non-negligible size. In this paper, we
ablate the learning of cross-task features and study its influence on the
performance of basic replay strategies used for class-IL. We also define a new
forgetting measure for class-incremental learning, and see that forgetting is
not the principal cause of low performance. Our experimental results show that
future algorithms for class-incremental learning should not only prevent
forgetting, but also aim to improve the quality of the cross-task features, and
the knowledge transfer between tasks. This is especially important when tasks
contain limited amount of data.

seasonal detrending and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to separate trends

identically distributed random variables with which the original time series
has a causal representation. The innovation at a time is statistically
independent of the history of the time series. As such, it represents the new
information contained at present but not in the past. Because of its simple
probability structure, an innovations sequence is the most efficient signature
of the original. Unlike the principle or independent component analysis
representations, an innovations sequence preserves not only the complete
statistical properties but also the temporal order of the original time series.
An long-standing open problem is to find a computationally tractable way to
extract an innovations sequence of non-Gaussian processes. This paper presents
a deep learning approach, referred to as Innovations Autoencoder (IAE), that
extracts innovations sequences using a causal convolutional neural network. An

biological neuronal networks, but they are typically trained using the
biologically unrealistic backpropagation algorithm and its variants. Predictive
coding has been proposed as a potentially more biologically realistic
alternative to backpropagation for training neural networks. This manuscript
reviews and extends recent work on the mathematical relationship between
predictive coding and backpropagation for training feedforward artificial
neural networks on supervised learning tasks. Implications of these results for
the interpretation of predictive coding and deep neural networks as models of
biological learning are discussed along with a repository of functions,
Torch2PC, for performing predictive coding with PyTorch neural network models.

'unnatural', representing, for example, behaviors with sudden accelerations
that waste energy and lack predictability. In this work, we present a novel
paradigm of controlling nonlinear systems via the minimization of the Koopman
spectrum cost: a cost over the Koopman operator of the controlled dynamics.
This induces a broader class of dynamical behaviors that evolve over stable
manifolds such as nonlinear oscillators, closed loops, and smooth movements. We
demonstrate that some dynamics characterizations that are not possible with a
cumulative cost are feasible in this paradigm, which generalizes the classical
eigenstructure and pole assignments to nonlinear decision making. Moreover, we
present a sample efficient online learning algorithm for our problem that
enjoys a sub-linear regret bound under some structural assumptions.

challenges in urban computing. However, current research efforts have primarily
focused on limited data sources, which fail to capture the complexity of urban
data arising from multiple entities and their interconnections. Therefore, a
comprehensive and multifaceted dataset is required to enable more extensive
studies in urban computing. In this paper, we present CityNet, a multi-modal
urban dataset that incorporates various data, including taxi trajectory,
traffic speed, point of interest (POI), road network, wind, rain, temperature,
and more, from seven cities. We categorize this comprehensive data into three
streams: mobility data, geographical data, and meteorological data. We begin by
detailing the generation process and basic properties of CityNet. Additionally,
we conduct extensive data mining and machine learning experiments, including
spatio-temporal predictions, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning, to
facilitate the use of CityNet. Our experimental results provide benchmarks for
various tasks and methods, and also reveal internal correlations among cities
and tasks within CityNet that can be leveraged to improve spatiotemporal
forecasting performance. Based on our benchmarking results and the correlations
uncovered, we believe that CityNet can significantly contribute to the field of
urban computing by enabling research on advanced topics.

  ligaments",,,,,physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph physics.data-an,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The size of drops generated by the capillary-driven disintegration of liquid
ligaments plays a fundamental role in several important natural phenomena,
ranging from heat and mass transfer at the ocean-atmosphere interface to
pathogen transmission. The inherent non-linearity of the equations governing
the ligament destabilization leads to significant differences in the resulting
drop sizes, owing to small fluctuations in the myriad initial conditions.
Previous experiments and simulations reveal a variety of drop size
distributions, corresponding to competing underlying physical interpretations.
Here, we perform numerical simulations of individual ligaments, the
deterministic breakup of which is triggered by random initial surface
corrugations. The simulations are grouped in a large ensemble, each
corresponding to a random initial configuration. The resulting probability
distributions reveal three stable drop sizes, generated via a sequence of two
distinct stages of breakup. Four different distributions are tested,
volume-based Poisson, Gaussian, Gamma and Log-Normal. Depending on the time,
range of droplet sizes and criteria for success, each distribution has
successes and failures. However the Log-Normal distribution roughly describes
the data when fitting both the primary peak and the tail of the distribution
while the number of droplets generated is the highest, while the Gamma and
Log-Normal distributions perform equally well when fitting the tail. The study
demonstrates a precisely controllable and reproducible framework, which can be
employed to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the polydispersity of
drop sizes found in complex fluid fragmentation scenarios.

to the inherent class imbalance. It is costly and time-demanding to manually
analyse the observed data, thus usually only few known anomalies if any are
available. Inspired by generative models and the analysis of the hidden
activations of neural networks, we introduce a novel unsupervised anomaly
detection method called DA3D. Here, we use adversarial autoencoders to generate
anomalous counterexamples based on the normal data only. These artificial
anomalies used during training allow the detection of real, yet unseen
anomalies. With our novel generative approach, we transform the unsupervised
task of anomaly detection to a supervised one, which is more tractable by
machine learning and especially deep learning methods. DA3D surpasses the
performance of state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in a purely
data-driven way, where no domain knowledge is required.

prediction intervals in regression settings, including Bayesian methods,
ensemble methods, direct interval estimation methods and conformal prediction
methods. An important issue is the calibration of these methods: the generated
prediction intervals should have a predefined coverage level, without being
overly conservative. In this work, we review the above four classes of methods
from a conceptual and experimental point of view. Results on benchmark data
sets from various domains highlight large fluctuations in performance from one
data set to another. These observations can be attributed to the violation of
certain assumptions that are inherent to some classes of methods. We illustrate
how conformal prediction can be used as a general calibration procedure for
methods that deliver poor results without a calibration step.

billionaire losses to global economies. Nowadays, the increasing number of
devices connected to the Internet makes it necessary to analyze large amounts
of network traffic data. In this work, we focus on increasing the performance
on botnet traffic classification by selecting those features that further
increase the detection rate. For this purpose we use two feature selection
techniques, Information Gain and Gini Importance, which led to three
pre-selected subsets of five, six and seven features. Then, we evaluate the
three feature subsets along with three models, Decision Tree, Random Forest and
k-Nearest Neighbors. To test the performance of the three feature vectors and
the three models we generate two datasets based on the CTU-13 dataset, namely
QB-CTU13 and EQB-CTU13. We measure the performance as the macro averaged F1
score over the computational time required to classify a sample. The results
show that the highest performance is achieved by Decision Trees using a five
feature set which obtained a mean F1 score of 85% classifying each sample in an
average time of 0.78 microseconds.

of gravitational wave astronomy, for example in surrogate modelling of
computationally expensive waveform models for binary black hole inspiral and
merger. Surrogate modelling yields fast and accurate approximations of
gravitational waves and neural networks have been used in the final step of
interpolating the coefficients of the surrogate model for arbitrary waveforms
outside the training sample. We investigate the existence of underlying
structures in the empirical interpolation coefficients using autoencoders. We
demonstrate that when the coefficient space is compressed to only two
dimensions, a spiral structure appears, wherein the spiral angle is linearly
related to the mass ratio. Based on this finding, we design a spiral module
with learnable parameters, that is used as the first layer in a neural network,
which learns to map the input space to the coefficients. The spiral module is
evaluated on multiple neural network architectures and consistently achieves
better speed-accuracy trade-off than baseline models. A thorough experimental
study is conducted and the final result is a surrogate model which can evaluate
millions of input parameters in a single forward pass in under 1ms on a desktop
GPU, while the mismatch between the corresponding generated waveforms and the
ground-truth waveforms is better than the compared baseline methods. We
anticipate the existence of analogous underlying structures and corresponding
computational gains also in the case of spinning black hole binaries.

single algorithm called the \emph{Bayesian learning rule}. The rule, derived
from Bayesian principles, yields a wide-range of algorithms from fields such as
optimization, deep learning, and graphical models. This includes classical
algorithms such as ridge regression, Newton's method, and Kalman filter, as
well as modern deep-learning algorithms such as stochastic-gradient descent,
RMSprop, and Dropout. The key idea in deriving such algorithms is to
approximate the posterior using candidate distributions estimated by using
natural gradients. Different candidate distributions result in different

variants of those algorithms. Our work not only unifies, generalizes, and
improves existing algorithms, but also helps us design new ones.

different impact on the final fitness value. It is defined with the value of
the exponent over the autocorrelation function values. Each function is used in
the corresponding optimization phase, and the optimization process switches
between these two phases until the stopping condition is satisfied. The
proposed algorithm was implemented using the compute unified device
architecture and therefore allowed us to exploit the computational power of
graphics processing units. This algorithm was tested on sequences with lengths
$L = 2^m - 1$, for $14 \le m \le 20$. From the obtained results it is evident
that the usage of two fitness functions improved the efficiency of the
algorithm significantly, new-best known solutions were achieved, and the
achieved PSL values were significantly less than $\sqrt{L}$.

  records: A systematic review of challenges and methodologies",,,10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103980,,cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Objective: Temporal electronic health records (EHRs) can be a wealth of
information for secondary uses, such as clinical events prediction or chronic
disease management. However, challenges exist for temporal data representation.
We therefore sought to identify these challenges and evaluate novel
methodologies for addressing them through a systematic examination of deep
learning solutions.
  Methods: We searched five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers [IEEE] Xplore Digital Library, the
Association for Computing Machinery [ACM] digital library, and Web of Science)
complemented with hand-searching in several prestigious computer science
conference proceedings. We sought articles that reported deep learning
methodologies on temporal data representation in structured EHR data from
January 1, 2010, to August 30, 2020. We summarized and analyzed the selected
articles from three perspectives: nature of time series, methodology, and model
implementation.
  Results: We included 98 articles related to temporal data representation
using deep learning. Four major challenges were identified, including data
irregularity, data heterogeneity, data sparsity, and model opacity. We then
studied how deep learning techniques were applied to address these challenges.
Finally, we discuss some open challenges arising from deep learning.
  Conclusion: Temporal EHR data present several major challenges for clinical
prediction modeling and data utilization. To some extent, current deep learning
solutions can address these challenges. Future studies can consider designing
comprehensive and integrated solutions. Moreover, researchers should
incorporate additional clinical domain knowledge into study designs and enhance
the interpretability of the model to facilitate its implementation in clinical
practice.

Further, the total available suitable habitat area is observed to have reduced,

when data are generated from a linear structural equation model (SEM) and the
causal structure can be characterized by a polytree. Under the Gaussian
polytree models, we study sufficient conditions on the sample sizes for the
well-known Chow-Liu algorithm to exactly recover both the skeleton and the
equivalence class of the polytree, which is uniquely represented by a CPDAG. On
the other hand, necessary conditions on the required sample sizes for both
skeleton and CPDAG recovery are also derived in terms of information-theoretic
lower bounds, which match the respective sufficient conditions and thereby give
a sharp characterization of the difficulty of these tasks. We also consider the
problem of inverse correlation matrix estimation under the linear polytree
models, and establish the estimation error bound in terms of the dimension and
the total number of v-structures. We also consider an extension of group linear
polytree models, in which each node represents a group of variables. Our
theoretical findings are illustrated by comprehensive numerical simulations,
and experiments on benchmark data also demonstrate the robustness of polytree
learning when the true graphical structures can only be approximated by
polytrees.

on current market information, has achieved promising advancements through
machine learning (ML) methods. Most existing ML methods, however, struggle with
the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic nature of financial
data, often mistaking noises for real trading signals without careful selection
of potentially profitable samples. To address this issue, we propose LARA, a
novel price movement forecasting framework with two main components:
Locality-Aware Attention (LA-Attention) and Iterative Refinement Labeling
(RA-Labeling). (1) LA-Attention, enhanced by metric learning techniques,
automatically extracts the potentially profitable samples through masked
attention scheme and task-specific distance metrics. (2) RA-Labeling further
iteratively refines the noisy labels of potentially profitable samples, and
combines the learned predictors robust to the unseen and noisy samples. In a
set of experiments on three real-world financial markets: stocks,
cryptocurrencies, and ETFs, LARA significantly outperforms several machine
learning based methods on the Qlib quantitative investment platform. Extensive
ablation studies confirm LARA's superior ability in capturing more reliable
trading opportunities.

component analysis (PCA) in high dimension, a problem that has been vastly
under-explored. While computing measures of uncertainty for nonlinear/nonconvex
estimators is in general difficult in high dimension, the challenge is further
compounded by the prevalent presence of missing data and heteroskedastic noise.
We propose a novel approach to performing valid inference on the principal
subspace under a spiked covariance model with missing data, on the basis of an
estimator called HeteroPCA (Zhang et al., 2022). We develop non-asymptotic
distributional guarantees for HeteroPCA, and demonstrate how these can be
invoked to compute both confidence regions for the principal subspace and
entrywise confidence intervals for the spiked covariance matrix. Our inference
procedures are fully data-driven and adaptive to heteroskedastic random noise,

induced polarization (IP) phenomenon using variational autoencoders (VAE). VAEs
are Bayesian neural networks that aim to learn a latent statistical
distribution to encode extensive data sets as lower dimension representations.
We collected 1 600 319 IP decay curves in various regions of Canada, the United
States and Kazakhstan, and compiled them to train a deep VAE. The proposed deep
learning approach is strictly unsupervised and data-driven: it does not require
manual processing or ground truth labeling of IP data. Moreover, our VAE
approach avoids the pitfalls of IP parametrization with the empirical Cole-Cole
and Debye decomposition models, simple power-law models, or other sophisticated
mechanistic models. We demonstrate four applications of VAEs to model and
process IP data: (1) representative synthetic data generation, (2) unsupervised
Bayesian denoising and data uncertainty estimation, (3) quantitative evaluation
of the signal-to-noise ratio, and (4) automated outlier detection. We also
interpret the IP compilation's latent representation and reveal a strong
correlation between its first dimension and the average chargeability of IP
decays. Finally, we experiment with varying VAE latent space dimensions and
demonstrate that a single real-valued scalar parameter contains sufficient
information to encode our extensive IP data compilation. This new finding
suggests that modeling time-domain IP data using mathematical models governed
by more than one free parameter is ambiguous, whereas modeling only the average
chargeability is justified. A pre-trained implementation of our model --
readily applicable to new IP data from any geolocation -- is available as
open-source Python code for the applied geophysics community.

practitioners in recent years. A key component of many micro-transport vehicles
is the DC motor, a complex dynamical system that is continuous and non-linear.
Learning to quickly control the DC motor in the presence of disturbances and
uncertainties is desired for various applications that require robustness and
stability. Techniques to accomplish this task usually rely on a mathematical
system model, which is often insufficient to anticipate the effects of
time-varying and interrelated sources of non-linearities. While some model-free
approaches have been successful at the task, they rely on massive interactions
with the system and are trained in specialized hardware in order to fit a
highly parameterized controller. In this work, we learn to steer a DC motor via
sample-efficient reinforcement learning. Using data collected from hardware
interactions in the real world, we additionally build a simulator to experiment
with a wide range of parameters and learning strategies. With the best
parameters found, we learn an effective control policy in one minute and 53
seconds on a simulation and in 10 minutes and 35 seconds on a physical system.

This type of problem can be found in numerous real-world scenarios, including
stochastic optimization and reinforcement learning, where each evaluation of a

(real-world activity) cost, likely to give different results each time. The
surrogate model does not incur this cost, but there are important trade-offs
and considerations involved in the choice and design of such methodologies. We
classify the different methodologies into three main classes and describe
specific instances of algorithms under a unified notation. A modular scheme
which encompasses the considered methods is also presented. A range of
application scenarios is discussed, with special attention to the
likelihood-free setting and reinforcement learning. Several numerical

understanding of a variety of physical phenomena. Many of these deviate from
Brownian motion, giving rise to anomalous diffusion. Various theoretical models
exists nowadays to describe such processes, but their application to
experimental setups is often challenging, due to the stochastic nature of the
phenomena and the difficulty to harness reliable data. The latter often
consists on short and noisy trajectories, which are hard to characterize with
usual statistical approaches. In recent years, we have witnessed an impressive
effort to bridge theory and experiments by means of supervised machine learning
techniques, with astonishing results. In this work, we explore the use of
unsupervised methods in anomalous diffusion data. We show that the main
diffusion characteristics can be learnt without the need of any labelling of
the data. We use such method to discriminate between anomalous diffusion models
and extract their physical parameters. Moreover, we explore the feasibility of
finding novel types of diffusion, in this case represented by compositions of
existing diffusion models. At last, we showcase the use of the method in
experimental data and demonstrate its advantages for cases where supervised
learning is not applicable.

  Ann O'Shea, Rafael A. Moral","Accounting for shared covariates in semi-parametric Bayesian additive
  regression trees","48 pages, 8 tables, 10 figures",,,,stat.ML cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We propose some extensions to semi-parametric models based on Bayesian
additive regression trees (BART). In the semi-parametric BART paradigm, the
response variable is approximated by a linear predictor and a BART model, where
the linear component is responsible for estimating the main effects and BART
accounts for non-specified interactions and non-linearities. Previous
semi-parametric models based on BART have assumed that the set of covariates in
the linear predictor and the BART model are mutually exclusive in an attempt to
avoid poor coverage properties and reduce bias in the estimates of the
parameters in the linear predictor. The main novelty in our approach lies in
the way we change the tree-generation moves in BART to deal with this bias and
resolve non-identifiability issues between the parametric and non-parametric
components, even when they have covariates in common. This allows us to model
complex interactions involving the covariates of primary interest, both among
themselves and with those in the BART component. Our novel method is developed
with a view to analysing data from an international education assessment, where
certain predictors of students' achievements in mathematics are of particular
interpretational interest. Through additional simulation studies and another
application to a well-known benchmark dataset, we also show competitive
performance when compared to regression models, alternative formulations of
semi-parametric BART, and other tree-based methods. The implementation of the
proposed method is available at \url{https://github.com/ebprado/CSP-BART}.

spectroscopic data which is expensive to gather. We present an algorithm that
weighs SMBHs using quasar light time series, circumventing the need for
expensive spectra. We train, validate, and test neural networks that directly
learn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 light curves for a
sample of $38,939$ spectroscopically confirmed quasars to map out the nonlinear
encoding between SMBH mass and multi-color optical light curves. We find a
1$\sigma$ scatter of 0.37 dex between the predicted SMBH mass and the fiducial
virial mass estimate based on SDSS single-epoch spectra, which is comparable to
the systematic uncertainty in the virial mass estimate. Our results have direct

decisions. Evaluating the efficacy of a given decision, however, can be
complicated -- e.g., decision outcomes are often long-term and relate to the
original decision in complex ways. Surprisingly, even though learning good
decision-making strategies is difficult, they can often be expressed in simple
and concise forms. Focusing on sequential decision-making, we design a novel
machine learning algorithm that is capable of extracting ""best practices"" from
trace data and conveying its insights to humans in the form of interpretable
""tips"". Our algorithm selects the tip that best bridges the gap between the
actions taken by human workers and those taken by the optimal policy in a way
that accounts for which actions are consequential for achieving higher
performance. We evaluate our approach through a series of randomized controlled
experiments where participants manage a virtual kitchen. Our experiments show
that the tips generated by our algorithm can significantly improve human
performance relative to intuitive baselines. In addition, we discuss a number
of empirical insights that can help inform the design of algorithms intended
for human-AI interfaces. For instance, we find evidence that participants do
not simply blindly follow our tips; instead, they combine them with their own
experience to discover additional strategies for improving performance.

distribution on non-convex loss functions. Let $F:[-1,1]^d\to\mathbb{R}$ be the

to find an estimate of the minimizer of $F$. Based on its observations, each

server collects signals of all machines and outputs an estimate of the
minimizer of $F$. We show that the expected loss of any algorithm is lower
bounded by $\max\big(1/(\sqrt{n}(mB)^{1/d}), 1/\sqrt{mn}\big)$, up to a
logarithmic factor. We then prove that this lower bound is order optimal in $m$

prediction and control. Tomorrow's machines may be closer to biological systems
in their mutability, resilience, and autonomy. But first they must be capable
of learning and retaining new information without being exposed to it
arbitrarily often. Past efforts to engineer such systems have sought to build
or regulate artificial neural networks using disjoint sets of weights that are
uniquely sensitive to specific tasks or inputs. This has not yet enabled
continual learning over long sequences of previously unseen data without
corrupting existing knowledge: a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. In
this paper, we introduce a system that can learn sequentially over previously
unseen datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100) with little forgetting over time. This is
done by controlling the activity of weights in a convolutional neural network
on the basis of inputs using top-down regulation generated by a second
feed-forward neural network. We find that our method learns continually under
domain transfer with sparse bursts of activity in weights that are recycled
across tasks, rather than by maintaining task-specific modules. Sparse synaptic
bursting is found to balance activity and suppression such that new functions
can be learned without corrupting extant knowledge, thus mirroring the balance
of order and disorder in systems at the edge of chaos. This behavior emerges
during a prior pre-training (or 'meta-learning') phase in which regulated

can synchronize their motion. We study multiple copies of an arbitrary
dynamical system in a stable limit cycle, described via a standard phase
reduction picture. The copies differ only in their arbitrary phases $\phi$.
Weak, randomly-timed external impulses applied to all the copies can
synchronize these phases over time. Beyond a threshold strength there is no
such convergence to a common phase. Instead, the synchronization becomes
erratic: successive impulses produce stochastic fluctuations in the phase
distribution $q(\phi)$, ranging from near-perfect to near-random
synchronization. Here we show that the sampled entropies of these phase
distributions themselves form a steady-state ensemble, whose average can be
made arbitrarily negative by tuning the impulse strength. A random-walk
description of the entropy's evolution accounts for the observed exponential
distribution of entropies and for the stochastic synchronization phenomenon.

daily transportation statistics and planning, which helps the smart city
construction. As one of the most important keys, crowd counting has drawn
increasing attention. Recent works achieved promising performance but relied on
the supervised paradigm with expensive crowd annotations. To alleviate the
annotation cost in real-world transportation scenarios, in this work we
proposed a semi-supervised learning framework $S^{4}\textit{Crowd}$, which can
leverage both unlabeled/labeled data for robust crowd counting. In the
unsupervised pathway, two \textit{self-supervised losses} were proposed to
simulate the crowd variations such as scale, illumination, based on which
supervised information pseudo labels were generated and gradually refined. We
also proposed a crowd-driven recurrent unit \textit{Gated-Crowd-Recurrent-Unit
(GCRU)}, which can preserve discriminant crowd information by extracting
second-order statistics, yielding pseudo labels with improved quality. A joint
loss including both unsupervised/supervised information was proposed, and a
dynamic weighting strategy was employed to balance the importance of the
unsupervised loss and supervised loss at different training stages. We
conducted extensive experiments on four popular crowd counting datasets in
semi-supervised settings. Experimental results supported the effectiveness of
each proposed component in our $S^{4}$Crowd framework. Our method achieved
competitive performance in semi-supervised learning approaches on these crowd
counting datasets.

evaluate if those computer-vision SSL frameworks are also effective on a
different modality (\textit{i.e.,} time series). The effectiveness is
experimented and evaluated on the UCR and UEA archives, and we show that the
computer vision SSL frameworks can be effective even for time series. In

  Applications to Reinforcement Learning","34 pages, 1 figure",,,,stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY math.PR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We begin by briefly surveying some results on the convergence of the
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Method, proved in a companion paper by the
present authors. These results are based on viewing SGD as a version of
Stochastic Approximation (SA). Ever since its introduction in the classic paper
of Robbins and Monro in 1951, SA has become a standard tool for finding a
solution of an equation of the form $f(\theta) = 0$, when only noisy
measurements of $f(\cdot)$ are available. In most situations, \textit{every
component} of the putative solution $\theta_t$ is updated at each step $t$. In
some applications in Reinforcement Learning (RL), \textit{only one component}
of $\theta_t$ is updated at each $t$. This is known as \textbf{asynchronous}
SA. In this paper, we study \textbf{Block Asynchronous SA (BASA)}, in which, at
each step $t$, \textit{some but not necessarily all} components of $\theta_t$
are updated. The theory presented here embraces both conventional (synchronous)
SA as well as asynchronous SA, and all in-between possibilities. We provide
sufficient conditions for the convergence of BASA, and also prove bounds on the
\textit{rate} of convergence of $\theta_t$ to the solution. For the case of
conventional SGD, these results reduce to those proved in our companion paper.
Then we apply these results to the problem of finding a fixed point of a map
with only noisy measurements. This problem arises frequently in RL. We prove
sufficient conditions for convergence as well as estimates for the rate of
convergence.

  System",CIKM 2021,,10.1145/3459637.3482093,,cs.IR cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Knowledge Distillation (KD), which transfers the knowledge of a well-trained
large model (teacher) to a small model (student), has become an important area
of research for practical deployment of recommender systems. Recently, Relaxed
Ranking Distillation (RRD) has shown that distilling the ranking information in
the recommendation list significantly improves the performance. However, the
method still has limitations in that 1) it does not fully utilize the
prediction errors of the student model, which makes the training not fully
efficient, and 2) it only distills the user-side ranking information, which
provides an insufficient view under the sparse implicit feedback. This paper
presents Dual Correction strategy for Distillation (DCD), which transfers the
ranking information from the teacher model to the student model in a more
efficient manner. Most importantly, DCD uses the discrepancy between the
teacher model and the student model predictions to decide which knowledge to be
distilled. By doing so, DCD essentially provides the learning guidance tailored
to ""correcting"" what the student model has failed to accurately predict. This
process is applied for transferring the ranking information from the user-side

of trustworthy ML. Numerous measures have been proposed in the literature;
however, none of them take an axiomatic approach to causal explainability. In
this work, we propose three explanation measures which aggregate the set of all
but-for causes -- a necessary and sufficient explanation -- into feature
importance weights. Our first measure is a natural adaptation of Chockler and
Halpern's notion of causal responsibility, whereas the other two correspond to
existing game-theoretic influence measures. We present an axiomatic treatment
for our proposed indices, showing that they can be uniquely characterized by a
set of desirable properties. We also extend our approach to derive a new method
to compute the Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf indices for black-box model
explanations. Finally, we analyze and compare the necessity and sufficiency of
all our proposed explanation measures in practice using the Adult-Income
dataset. Thus, our work is the first to formally bridge the gap between model
explanations, game-theoretic influence, and causal analysis.

  Prediction",,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3349957,,cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Vessel trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in numerous maritime
applications and services. While the Automatic Identification System (AIS)
offers a rich source of information to address this task, forecasting vessel
trajectory using AIS data remains challenging, even for modern machine learning
techniques, because of the inherent heterogeneous and multimodal nature of
motion data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle these
challenges. We introduce a discrete, high-dimensional representation of AIS
data and a new loss function designed to explicitly address heterogeneity and
multimodality. The proposed model-referred to as TrAISformer-is a modified
transformer network that extracts long-term temporal patterns in AIS vessel
trajectories in the proposed enriched space to forecast the positions of
vessels several hours ahead. We report experimental results on real, publicly
available AIS data. TrAISformer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, with an average prediction performance below 10 nautical miles up to
~10 hours.

  Transitions",,,,,stat.ML cs.LG math.OC math.ST stat.TH,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We study the problem of designing optimal learning and decision-making
formulations when only historical data is available. Prior work typically
commits to a particular class of data-driven formulation and subsequently tries
to establish out-of-sample performance guarantees. We take here the opposite
approach. We define first a sensible yard stick with which to measure the
quality of any data-driven formulation and subsequently seek to find an optimal
such formulation. Informally, any data-driven formulation can be seen to
balance a measure of proximity of the estimated cost to the actual cost while
guaranteeing a level of out-of-sample performance. Given an acceptable level of
out-of-sample performance, we construct explicitly a data-driven formulation
that is uniformly closer to the true cost than any other formulation enjoying
the same out-of-sample performance. We show the existence of three distinct
out-of-sample performance regimes (a superexponential regime, an exponential
regime and a subexponential regime) between which the nature of the optimal
data-driven formulation experiences a phase transition. The optimal data-driven
formulations can be interpreted as a classically robust formulation in the
superexponential regime, an entropic distributionally robust formulation in the
exponential regime and finally a variance penalized formulation in the
subexponential regime. This final observation unveils a surprising connection
between these three, at first glance seemingly unrelated, data-driven
formulations which until now remained hidden.

  http://jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-0269.html",,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Bayesian optimization (BO) has become a popular strategy for global
optimization of expensive real-world functions. Contrary to a common
expectation that BO is suited to optimizing black-box functions, it actually
requires domain knowledge about those functions to deploy BO successfully. Such
domain knowledge often manifests in Gaussian process (GP) priors that specify
initial beliefs on functions. However, even with expert knowledge, it is
non-trivial to quantitatively define a prior. This is especially true for
hyperparameter tuning problems on complex machine learning models, where
landscapes of tuning objectives are often difficult to comprehend. We seek an
alternative practice for setting these functional priors. In particular, we
consider the scenario where we have data from similar functions that allow us
to pre-train a tighter distribution a priori. We detail what pre-training
entails for GPs using a KL divergence based loss function, and propose a new
pre-training based BO framework named HyperBO. Theoretically, we show bounded
posterior predictions and near-zero regrets for HyperBO without assuming the
""ground truth"" GP prior is known. To verify our approach in realistic setups,
we collect a large multi-task hyperparameter tuning dataset by training tens of
thousands of configurations of near-state-of-the-art deep learning models on
popular image and text datasets, as well as a protein sequence dataset. Our
results show that on average, HyperBO is able to locate good hyperparameters at
least 3 times more efficiently than the best competing methods on both our new
tuning dataset and existing multi-task BO benchmarks.

  Goel","Learning to be Fair: A Consequentialist Approach to Equitable
  Decision-Making",,,,,cs.LG cs.CY,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In an attempt to make algorithms fair, the machine learning literature has
largely focused on equalizing decisions, outcomes, or error rates across race
or gender groups. To illustrate, consider a hypothetical government rideshare
program that provides transportation assistance to low-income people with
upcoming court dates. Following this literature, one might allocate rides to
those with the highest estimated treatment effect per dollar, while
constraining spending to be equal across race groups. That approach, however,
ignores the downstream consequences of such constraints, and, as a result, can
induce unexpected harms. For instance, if one demographic group lives farther
from court, enforcing equal spending would necessarily mean fewer total rides
provided, and potentially more people penalized for missing court. Here we
present an alternative framework for designing equitable algorithms that
foregrounds the consequences of decisions. In our approach, one first elicits
stakeholder preferences over the space of possible decisions and the resulting
outcomes--such as preferences for balancing spending parity against court
appearance rates. We then optimize over the space of decision policies, making
trade-offs in a way that maximizes the elicited utility. To do so, we develop
an algorithm for efficiently learning these optimal policies from data for a
large family of expressive utility functions. In particular, we use a
contextual bandit algorithm to explore the space of policies while solving a
convex optimization problem at each step to estimate the best policy based on
the available information. This consequentialist paradigm facilitates a more
holistic approach to equitable decision-making.

  Variable Selection",This work has already been accepted in AutoML 2023,,,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a method for globally optimizing black-box
functions. While BO has been successfully applied to many scenarios, developing
effective BO algorithms that scale to functions with high-dimensional domains
is still a challenge. Optimizing such functions by vanilla BO is extremely
time-consuming. Alternative strategies for high-dimensional BO that are based
on the idea of embedding the high-dimensional space to the one with low
dimension are sensitive to the choice of the embedding dimension, which needs
to be pre-specified. We develop a new computationally efficient
high-dimensional BO method that exploits variable selection. Our method is able
to automatically learn axis-aligned sub-spaces, i.e. spaces containing selected
variables, without the demand of any pre-specified hyperparameters. We
theoretically analyze the computational complexity of our algorithm and derive
the regret bound. We empirically show the efficacy of our method on several
synthetic and real problems.

smart cities in many aspects, such as providing real-time air quality
information to assist human decision-making. However, it is impractical to
deploy massive sensors due to the expensive costs, resulting in sparse data
collection. Therefore, how to get fine-grained data measurement has long been a
pressing issue. In this paper, we aim to infer values at non-sensor locations
based on observations from available sensors (termed spatiotemporal inference),
where capturing spatiotemporal relationships among the data plays a critical
role. Our investigations reveal two significant insights that have not been
explored by previous works. Firstly, data exhibits distinct patterns at both
long- and short-term temporal scales, which should be analyzed separately.
Secondly, short-term patterns contain more delicate relations including those
across spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously, while long-term patterns
involve high-level temporal trends. Based on these observations, we propose to
decouple the modeling of short-term and long-term patterns. Specifically, we
introduce a joint spatiotemporal graph attention network to learn the relations
across space and time for short-term patterns. Furthermore, we propose a graph
recurrent network with a time skip strategy to alleviate the gradient vanishing
problem and model the long-term dependencies. Experimental results on four
public real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively captures
both long- and short-term relations, achieving state-of-the-art performance
against existing methods.

  Sales with Image-based Google Trends",Accepted by the Wiley Journal of Forecasting,,10.1002/for.3104,,cs.CV cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  New fashion product sales forecasting is a challenging problem that involves
many business dynamics and cannot be solved by classical forecasting
approaches. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of systematically
probing exogenous knowledge in the form of Google Trends time series and
combining it with multi-modal information related to a brand-new fashion item,
in order to effectively forecast its sales despite the lack of past data. In
particular, we propose a neural network-based approach, where an encoder learns
a representation of the exogenous time series, while the decoder forecasts the
sales based on the Google Trends encoding and the available visual and metadata
information. Our model works in a non-autoregressive manner, avoiding the
compounding effect of large first-step errors. As a second contribution, we
present VISUELLE, a publicly available dataset for the task of new fashion
product sales forecasting, containing multimodal information for 5577 real, new
products sold between 2016-2019 from Nunalie, an Italian fast-fashion company.
The dataset is equipped with images of products, metadata, related sales, and
associated Google Trends. We use VISUELLE to compare our approach against
state-of-the-art alternatives and several baselines, showing that our neural
network-based approach is the most accurate in terms of both percentage and
absolute error. It is worth noting that the addition of exogenous knowledge
boosts the forecasting accuracy by 1.5% in terms of Weighted Absolute
Percentage Error (WAPE), revealing the importance of exploiting informative
external information. The code and dataset are both available at
https://github.com/HumaticsLAB/GTM-Transformer.

  Graph Learning for Click-Through Rate Prediction",,,,,cs.IR,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In this paper, we propose a novel model named DemiNet (short for
DEpendency-Aware Multi-Interest Network) to address the above two issues. To be
specific, we first consider various dependency types between item nodes and
perform dependency-aware heterogeneous attention for denoising and obtaining
accurate sequence item representations. Secondly, for multiple interests
extraction, multi-head attention is conducted on top of the graph embedding. To
filter out noisy inter-item correlations and enhance the robustness of
extracted interests, self-supervised interest learning is introduced to the
above two steps. Thirdly, to aggregate the multiple interests, interest experts
corresponding to different interest routes give rating scores respectively,
while a specialized network assigns the confidence of each score. Experimental
results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed DemiNet
significantly improves the overall recommendation performance over several
state-of-the-art baselines. Further studies verify the efficacy and
interpretability benefits brought by the fine-grained user interest modeling.

through exposure of experience or data. Throughout this journey, the agent may
encounter diverse learning environments. For example, data may be presented to
the leaner all at once, in multiple batches, or sequentially. Furthermore, the
distribution of each data sample could be either identical and independent
(iid) or non-iid. Additionally, there may exist computational and space
constraints for the deployment of the learning algorithms. The complexity of a
learning task can vary significantly, depending on the learning setup and the
constraints imposed upon it. However, it is worth noting that the current
literature lacks formal definitions for many of the in-distribution and
out-of-distribution learning paradigms. Establishing proper and universally
agreed-upon definitions for these learning setups is essential for thoroughly
exploring the evolution of ideas across different learning scenarios and
deriving generalized mathematical bounds for these learners. In this paper, we
aim to address this issue by proposing a chronological approach to defining
different learning tasks using the provably approximately correct (PAC)
learning framework. We will start with in-distribution learning and progress to
recently proposed lifelong or continual learning. We employ consistent
terminology and notation to demonstrate how each of these learning frameworks
represents a specific instance of a broader, more generalized concept of
learnability. Our hope is that this work will inspire a universally agreed-upon
approach to quantifying different types of learning, fostering greater
understanding and progress in the field.

that makes computer-aided assessments a vital approach to rapid drug discovery.
Here we develop a machine learning algorithm, iMiner, that generates novel
inhibitor molecules for target proteins by combining deep reinforcement
learning with real-time 3D molecular docking using AutoDock Vina, thereby
simultaneously creating chemical novelty while constraining molecules for shape
and molecular compatibility with target active sites. Moreover, through the use
of various types of reward functions, we can generate new molecules that are
chemically similar to a target ligand, which can be grown from known protein
bound fragments, as well as to create molecules that enforce interactions with
target residues in the protein active site. The iMiner algorithm is embedded in
a composite workflow that filters out Pan-assay interference compounds,
Lipinski rule violations, and poor synthetic accessibility, with options for
cross-validation against other docking scoring functions and automation of a
molecular dynamics simulation to measure pose stability. Because our approach
only relies on the structure of the target protein, iMiner can be easily
adapted for future development of other inhibitors or small molecule
therapeutics of any target protein.

One target of particular public interest is based on four criteria determined
from recent E. coli readings, and concerns the health risk of swimming in a

determine the water quality state and trend reliably, particularly using
traditional methods based on percentiles. Therefore, in this study we return to
the parametric lognormal model of E. coli distribution, from which the official
criteria were developed. We interpret the classification system in terms of the
parametric model and show that the parametric model can reduce uncertainty and
can incorporate more useful information, especially from very high E. coli

vision is unreliable (e.g., when we realize that we are experiencing a visual
illusion). Inspired by this capacity, we present MetaCOG: a hierarchical
probabilistic model that can be attached to a neural object detector to monitor
its outputs and determine their reliability. MetaCOG achieves this by learning
a probabilistic model of the object detector's performance via Bayesian
inference -- i.e., a meta-cognitive representation of the network's propensity
to hallucinate or miss different object categories. Given a set of video frames
processed by an object detector, MetaCOG performs joint inference over the
underlying 3D scene and the detector's performance, grounding inference on a
basic assumption of object permanence. Paired with three neural object
detectors, we show that MetaCOG accurately recovers each detector's performance
parameters and improves the overall system's accuracy. We additionally show
that MetaCOG is robust to varying levels of error in object detector outputs,
showing proof-of-concept for a novel approach to the problem of detecting and
correcting errors in vision systems when ground-truth is not available.

  Yuandong Tian",Multi-objective Optimization by Learning Space Partitions,,International Conference on Learning Representations 2022,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In contrast to single-objective optimization (SOO), multi-objective
optimization (MOO) requires an optimizer to find the Pareto frontier, a subset
of feasible solutions that are not dominated by other feasible solutions. In
this paper, we propose LaMOO, a novel multi-objective optimizer that learns a
model from observed samples to partition the search space and then focus on
promising regions that are likely to contain a subset of the Pareto frontier.
The partitioning is based on the dominance number, which measures ""how close"" a
data point is to the Pareto frontier among existing samples. To account for
possible partition errors due to limited samples and model mismatch, we
leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to exploit promising regions while
exploring suboptimal regions that may turn out to contain good solutions later.
Theoretically, we prove the efficacy of learning space partitioning via LaMOO
under certain assumptions. Empirically, on the HyperVolume (HV) benchmark, a
popular MOO metric, LaMOO substantially outperforms strong baselines on
multiple real-world MOO tasks, by up to 225% in sample efficiency for neural
architecture search on Nasbench201, and up to 10% for molecular design.

oversight over 'black-box' algorithms used in high-stakes applications such as
lending, medical testing, or hiring. In our model, a regulator is limited in
how much she can learn about a black-box model deployed by an agent with
misaligned preferences. The regulator faces two choices: first, whether to
allow for the use of complex algorithms; and second, which key properties of
algorithms to regulate. We show that limiting agents to algorithms that are
simple enough to be fully transparent is inefficient as long as the
misalignment is limited and complex algorithms have sufficiently better
performance than simple ones. Allowing for complex algorithms can improve
welfare, but the gains depend on how the regulator regulates them. Regulation
that focuses on the overall average behavior of algorithms, for example based
on standard explainer tools, will generally be inefficient. Targeted regulation
that focuses on the source of incentive misalignment, e.g., excess false
positives or racial disparities, can provide second-best solutions. We provide
empirical support for our theoretical findings using an application in consumer
lending, where we document that complex models regulated based on
context-specific explanation tools outperform simple, fully transparent models.
This gain from complex models represents a Pareto improvement across our
empirical applications that is preferred both by the lender and from the
perspective of the financial regulator.

obtain certifiably robust classifiers. Despite its remarkable performance, the
method is associated with various serious problems such as ""certified accuracy
waterfalls"", certification vs.\ accuracy trade-off, or even fairness issues.
Input-dependent smoothing approaches have been proposed with intention of
overcoming these flaws. However, we demonstrate that these methods lack formal
guarantees and so the resulting certificates are not justified. We show that in
general, the input-dependent smoothing suffers from the curse of
dimensionality, forcing the variance function to have low semi-elasticity. On
the other hand, we provide a theoretical and practical framework that enables
the usage of input-dependent smoothing even in the presence of the curse of
dimensionality, under strict restrictions. We present one concrete design of
the smoothing variance function and test it on CIFAR10 and MNIST. Our design
mitigates some of the problems of classical smoothing and is formally
underlined, yet further improvement of the design is still necessary.

  modeling of single-cell RNA data",,"Bioinformatics, Volume 39, Issue 9, September 2023",10.1093/bioinformatics/btad497,,cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Learning low-dimensional representations of single-cell transcriptomics has
become instrumental to its downstream analysis. The state of the art is
currently represented by neural network models such as variational autoencoders
(VAEs) which use a variational approximation of the likelihood for inference.
We here present the Deep Generative Decoder (DGD), a simple generative model
that computes model parameters and representations directly via maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimation. The DGD handles complex parameterized latent
distributions naturally unlike VAEs which typically use a fixed Gaussian
distribution, because of the complexity of adding other types. We first show
its general functionality on a commonly used benchmark set, Fashion-MNIST.
Secondly, we apply the model to multiple single-cell data sets. Here the DGD
learns low-dimensional, meaningful and well-structured latent representations
with sub-clustering beyond the provided labels. The advantages of this approach
are its simplicity and its capability to provide representations of much
smaller dimensionality than a comparable VAE.

dimensional structure underlying the higher dimensional observations. As a
flexible class of nonlinear structures, it is common to focus on Riemannian
manifolds. Most existing manifold learning algorithms replace the original data
with lower dimensional coordinates without providing an estimate of the
manifold in the observation space or using the manifold to denoise the original
data. This article proposes a new methodology for addressing these problems,
allowing interpolation of the estimated manifold between fitted data points.
The proposed approach is motivated by novel theoretical properties of local
covariance matrices constructed from noisy samples on a manifold. Our results
enable us to turn a global manifold reconstruction problem into a local
regression problem, allowing application of Gaussian processes for
probabilistic manifold reconstruction. In addition to theory justifying the
algorithm, we provide simulated and real data examples to illustrate the
performance.

and safety of machine learning systems. For instance, in autonomous driving, we
would like the driving system to issue an alert and hand over the control to
humans when it detects unusual scenes or objects that it has never seen during
training time and cannot make a safe decision. The term, OOD detection, first
emerged in 2017 and since then has received increasing attention from the
research community, leading to a plethora of methods developed, ranging from
classification-based to density-based to distance-based ones. Meanwhile,
several other problems, including anomaly detection (AD), novelty detection
(ND), open set recognition (OSR), and outlier detection (OD), are closely
related to OOD detection in terms of motivation and methodology. Despite common
goals, these topics develop in isolation, and their subtle differences in
definition and problem setting often confuse readers and practitioners. In this
survey, we first present a unified framework called generalized OOD detection,
which encompasses the five aforementioned problems, i.e., AD, ND, OSR, OOD
detection, and OD. Under our framework, these five problems can be seen as
special cases or sub-tasks, and are easier to distinguish. We then review each
of these five areas by summarizing their recent technical developments, with a

  Limit While Maintaining Performance",Published in IEEE Access,"IEEE Access (2023), Volume: 11, Page(s): 102981 - 102990",10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3312572,,cs.LG cs.DC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Recent deep learning models are difficult to train using a large batch size,
because commodity machines may not have enough memory to accommodate both the
model and a large data batch size. The batch size is one of the
hyper-parameters used in the training model, and it is dependent on and is
limited by the target machine memory capacity because the batch size can only
fit into the remaining memory after the model is uploaded. Moreover, the data
item size is also an important factor because if each data item size is larger
then the batch size that can fit into the remaining memory becomes smaller.
This paper proposes a method called Micro-Batch Processing (MBP) to address
this problem. This method helps deep learning models to train by providing a
batch processing method that splits a batch into a size that can fit in the
remaining memory and processes them sequentially. After processing the small
batches individually, a loss normalization algorithm based on the gradient
accumulation is used to maintain the performance. The purpose of our method is
to allow deep learning models to train using larger batch sizes that exceed the
memory capacity of a system without increasing the memory size or using
multiple devices (GPUs).

2110.14048,Bo Liu,Bo Liu and Xingchao Liu and Xiaojie Jin and Peter Stone and Qiang Liu,Conflict-Averse Gradient Descent for Multi-task Learning,"20 pages, 6 figures, Conference on Neural Information Processing
  Systems, 2021",,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The goal of multi-task learning is to enable more efficient learning than
single task learning by sharing model structures for a diverse set of tasks. A
standard multi-task learning objective is to minimize the average loss across
all tasks. While straightforward, using this objective often results in much
worse final performance for each task than learning them independently. A major
challenge in optimizing a multi-task model is the conflicting gradients, where
gradients of different task objectives are not well aligned so that following
the average gradient direction can be detrimental to specific tasks'
performance. Previous work has proposed several heuristics to manipulate the
task gradients for mitigating this problem. But most of them lack convergence
guarantee and/or could converge to any Pareto-stationary point. In this paper,
we introduce Conflict-Averse Gradient descent (CAGrad) which minimizes the
average loss function, while leveraging the worst local improvement of
individual tasks to regularize the algorithm trajectory. CAGrad balances the
objectives automatically and still provably converges to a minimum over the
average loss. It includes the regular gradient descent (GD) and the multiple
gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) in the multi-objective optimization (MOO)
literature as special cases. On a series of challenging multi-task supervised
learning and reinforcement learning tasks, CAGrad achieves improved performance
over prior state-of-the-art multi-objective gradient manipulation methods.

  Risto Miikkulainen",NeuroBack: Improving CDCL SAT Solving using Graph Neural Networks,Paper has been accepted by ICLR'24,,,,cs.AI cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Propositional satisfiability (SAT) is an NP-complete problem that impacts
many research fields, such as planning, verification, and security. Mainstream
modern SAT solvers are based on the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)
algorithm. Recent work aimed to enhance CDCL SAT solvers using Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). However, so far this approach either has not made solving more
effective, or required substantial GPU resources for frequent online model
inferences. Aiming to make GNN improvements practical, this paper proposes an
approach called NeuroBack, which builds on two insights: (1) predicting phases
(i.e., values) of variables appearing in the majority (or even all) of the
satisfying assignments are essential for CDCL SAT solving, and (2) it is
sufficient to query the neural model only once for the predictions before the
SAT solving starts. Once trained, the offline model inference allows NeuroBack
to execute exclusively on the CPU, removing its reliance on GPU resources. To
train NeuroBack, a new dataset called DataBack containing 120,286 data samples
is created. NeuroBack is implemented as an enhancement to a state-of-the-art
SAT solver called Kissat. As a result, it allowed Kissat to solve up to 5.2%
and 7.4% more problems on two recent SAT competition problem sets, SATCOMP-2022
and SATCOMP-2023, respectively. NeuroBack therefore shows how machine learning
can be harnessed to improve SAT solving in an effective and practical manner.

namely systems of interacting objects with highly non-linear and time-dependent
behaviour. A large class of such systems can be formalized as
$\textit{geometric graphs}$, $\textit{i.e.}$, graphs with nodes positioned in
the Euclidean space given an $\textit{arbitrarily}$ chosen global coordinate
system, for instance vehicles in a traffic scene. Notwithstanding the arbitrary
global coordinate system, the governing dynamics of the respective dynamical
systems are invariant to rotations and translations, also known as
$\textit{Galilean invariance}$. As ignoring these invariances leads to worse
generalization, in this work we propose local coordinate frames per node-object
to induce roto-translation invariance to the geometric graph of the interacting
dynamical system. Further, the local coordinate frames allow for a natural
definition of anisotropic filtering in graph neural networks. Experiments in

invariant quantity, allowing to measure the effective size of a metric space.
Despite encouraging first results demonstrating the descriptive abilities of
the magnitude, such as being able to detect the boundary of a metric space, the
potential use cases of magnitude remain under-explored. In this work, we
investigate the properties of the magnitude on images, an important data
modality in many machine learning applications. By endowing each individual
images with its own metric space, we are able to define the concept of
magnitude on images and analyse the individual contribution of each pixel with
the magnitude vector. In particular, we theoretically show that the previously
known properties of boundary detection translate to edge detection abilities in
images. Furthermore, we demonstrate practical use cases of magnitude for
machine learning applications and propose a novel magnitude model that consists
of a computationally efficient magnitude computation and a learnable metric. By
doing so, we address the computational hurdle that used to make magnitude

open-source projects with fewer barriers. Nevertheless, a considerable amount
of pull requests (PRs) with valid contributions are abandoned by their
contributors, wasting the effort and time put in by both the contributors and
maintainers. To better understand the underlying dynamics of
contributor-abandoned PRs, we conduct a mixed-methods study using both
quantitative and qualitative methods. We curate a dataset consisting of 265,325
PRs including 4,450 abandoned ones from ten popular and mature GitHub projects
and measure 16 features characterizing PRs, contributors, review processes, and
projects. Using statistical and machine learning techniques, we find that
complex PRs, novice contributors, and lengthy reviews have a higher probability
of abandonment and the rate of PR abandonment fluctuates alongside the
projects' maturity or workload. To identify why contributors abandon their PRs,
we also manually examine a random sample of 354 abandoned PRs. We observe that
the most frequent abandonment reasons are related to the obstacles faced by
contributors, followed by the hurdles imposed by maintainers during the review
process. Finally, we survey the top core maintainers of the studied projects to
understand their perspectives on dealing with PR abandonment and on our
findings.

proximity to mitigate the limitations possessed by cloud computing. Fog
environment made its limited resource available to a large number of users to
deploy their serverless applications, composed of several serverless functions.
One of the primary intentions behind introducing the fog environment is to
fulfil the demand of latency and location-sensitive serverless applications
through its limited resources. The recent research mainly focuses on assigning
maximum resources to such applications from the fog node and not taking full
advantage of the cloud environment. This introduces a negative impact in
providing the resources to a maximum number of connected users. To address this
issue, in this paper, we investigated the optimum percentage of a user's
request that should be fulfilled by fog and cloud. As a result, we proposed
DeF-DReL, a Systematic Deployment of Serverless Functions in Fog and Cloud
environments using Deep Reinforcement Learning, using several real-life
parameters, such as distance and latency of the users from nearby fog node,
user's priority, the priority of the serverless applications and their resource
demand, etc. The performance of the DeF-DReL algorithm is further compared with
recent related algorithms. From the simulation and comparison results, its
superiority over other algorithms and its applicability to the real-life
scenario can be clearly observed.

Following a novel approach, we formulate the problem of intrusion prevention as
an (optimal) multiple stopping problem. This formulation gives us insight into
the structure of optimal policies, which we show to have threshold properties.
For most practical cases, it is not feasible to obtain an optimal defender
policy using dynamic programming. We therefore develop a reinforcement learning
approach to approximate an optimal threshold policy. We introduce T-SPSA, an
efficient reinforcement learning algorithm that learns threshold policies
through stochastic approximation. We show that T-SPSA outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms for our use case. Our overall method for learning
and validating policies includes two systems: a simulation system where
defender policies are incrementally learned and an emulation system where
statistics are produced that drive simulation runs and where learned policies
are evaluated. We show that this approach can produce effective defender
policies for a practical IT infrastructure.

necessary routine of ultrashort-pulse characterisation. The majority of pulse
characterisation approaches solve either a one-dimensional (e.g. via
interferometry) or a two-dimensional (e.g. via frequency-resolved measurements)
problem. Solution of the two-dimensional pulse-retrieval problem is generally
more consistent due to problem's over-determined nature. In contrast, the
one-dimensional pulse-retrieval problem is impossible to solve unambiguously as
ultimately imposed by the fundamental theorem of algebra. In cases where
additional constraints are involved, the one-dimensional problem may be
possible to solve, however, existing iterative algorithms lack generality, and
often stagnate for complicated pulse shapes. Here we use a deep neural network
to unambiguously solve a constrained one-dimensional pulse-retrieval problem
and show the potential of fast, reliable, and complete pulse characterisation
using interferometric cross-correlation time traces (determined by the pulses
with partial spectral overlap).

  estimation",,,,,cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Classification is one of the main areas of pattern recognition research, and
within it, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most popular methods
outside of field of deep learning -- and a de-facto reference for many Machine
Learning approaches. Its performance is determined by parameter selection,
which is usually achieved by a time-consuming grid search cross-validation
procedure (GSCV). That method, however relies on the availability and quality
of labelled examples and thus, when those are limited can be hindered. To
address that problem, there exist several unsupervised heuristics that take
advantage of the characteristics of the dataset for selecting parameters
instead of using class label information. While an order of magnitude faster,
they are scarcely used under the assumption that their results are
significantly worse than those of grid search. To challenge that assumption, we
have proposed improved heuristics for SVM parameter selection and tested it
against GSCV and state of the art heuristics on over 30 standard classification
datasets. The results show not only its advantage over state-of-art heuristics
but also that it is statistically no worse than GSCV.

  Neural Networks and Large Language Models","12 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, under review",,,,cs.LG cs.CL cs.CV cs.HC cs.IR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Web automation holds the potential to revolutionize how users interact with
the digital world, offering unparalleled assistance and simplifying tasks via
sophisticated computational methods. Central to this evolution is the web
element nomination task, which entails identifying unique elements on webpages.
Unfortunately, the development of algorithmic designs for web automation is
hampered by the scarcity of comprehensive and realistic datasets that reflect
the complexity faced by real-world applications on the Web. To address this, we
introduce the Klarna Product Page Dataset, a comprehensive and diverse
collection of webpages that surpasses existing datasets in richness and
variety. The dataset features 51,701 manually labeled product pages from 8,175
e-commerce websites across eight geographic regions, accompanied by a dataset
of rendered page screenshots. To initiate research on the Klarna Product Page
Dataset, we empirically benchmark a range of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on
the web element nomination task. We make three important contributions. First,
we found that a simple Convolutional GNN (GCN) outperforms complex
state-of-the-art nomination methods. Second, we introduce a training refinement
procedure that involves identifying a small number of relevant elements from
each page using the aforementioned GCN. These elements are then passed to a
large language model for the final nomination. This procedure significantly
improves the nomination accuracy by 16.8 percentage points on our challenging
dataset, without any need for fine-tuning. Finally, in response to another
prevalent challenge in this field - the abundance of training methodologies
suitable for element nomination - we introduce the Challenge Nomination
Training Procedure, a novel training approach that further boosts nomination
accuracy.

misclassification error rate. However, in applications such as loan default
prediction, different types of errors can have varying consequences. To address
this asymmetry issue, two popular paradigms have been developed: the
Neyman-Pearson (NP) paradigm and the cost-sensitive (CS) paradigm. Previous
studies on the NP paradigm have primarily focused on the binary case, while the
multi-class NP problem poses a greater challenge due to its unknown
feasibility. In this work, we tackle the multi-class NP problem by establishing
a connection with the CS problem via strong duality and propose two algorithms.
We extend the concept of NP oracle inequalities, crucial in binary
classifications, to NP oracle properties in the multi-class context. Our
algorithms satisfy these NP oracle properties under certain conditions.
Furthermore, we develop practical algorithms to assess the feasibility and
strong duality in multi-class NP problems, which can offer practitioners the
landscape of a multi-class NP problem with various target error levels.
Simulations and real data studies validate the effectiveness of our algorithms.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to address the multi-class NP problem
with theoretical guarantees. The proposed algorithms have been implemented in
the R package \texttt{npcs}, which is available on CRAN.

phenomenon in learning theory. With variants ranging from classical settings
like PAC learning and regression to recent trends such as adversarially robust
learning, it's surprising that we still lack a unified theory; traditional
proofs of the equivalence tend to be disparate, and rely on strong
model-specific assumptions like uniform convergence and sample compression.
  In this work, we give the first model-independent framework explaining the
equivalence of realizable and agnostic learnability: a three-line blackbox
reduction that simplifies, unifies, and extends our understanding across a wide
variety of settings. This includes models with no known characterization of
learnability such as learning with arbitrary distributional assumptions and
more general loss functions, as well as a host of other popular settings such
as robust learning, partial learning, fair learning, and the statistical query
model.
  More generally, we argue that the equivalence of realizable and agnostic
learning is actually a special case of a broader phenomenon we call property
generalization: any desirable property of a learning algorithm (e.g. noise
tolerance, privacy, stability) that can be satisfied over finite hypothesis
classes extends (possibly in some variation) to any learnable hypothesis class.

ethology, control theory, and mathematics. Our generative Hilbert framework
applied to the trajectories of small groups of swimming fish outperformed
state-of-the-art traditional mathematical behavioral models and current
ANN-based models. We demonstrate pure data interpolation based control by
stabilizing an inverted pendulum and a driven logistic map around unstable
fixed points. Finally, we present a mathematical application by predicting
zeros of the Riemann Zeta function, achieving comparable performance as a
transformer network. We do not suggest that the proposed framework will always
outperform networks as over-parameterized networks can interpolate. However,
our framework is theoretically sound, transparent, deterministic, and parameter
free: remarkably, it does not require any compute-expensive training, does not
involve optimization, has no model selection, and is easily reproduced and
ported. We also propose an easily computed method of credit assignment based on
this framework, to help address ethical-legal challenges raised by generative
AI.
,   Anomaly detection is a challenging task for machine learning algorithms due
to the inherent class imbalance. It is costly and time-demanding to manually
analyse the observed data, thus usually only few known anomalies if any are
available. Inspired by generative models and the analysis of the hidden
activations of neural networks, we introduce a novel unsupervised anomaly
detection method called DA3D. Here, we use adversarial autoencoders to generate
anomalous counterexamples based on the normal data only. These artificial
anomalies used during training allow the detection of real, yet unseen
anomalies. With our novel generative approach, we transform the unsupervised
task of anomaly detection to a supervised one, which is more tractable by
machine learning and especially deep learning methods. DA3D surpasses the
performance of state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in a purely
data-driven way, where no domain knowledge is required.

of a sparse, high-dimensional stationary multivariate Gaussian time series. A
sparse-group lasso-based frequency-domain formulation of the problem based on
frequency-domain sufficient statistic for the observed time series is
presented. We investigate an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
approach for optimization of the sparse-group lasso penalized log-likelihood.
We provide sufficient conditions for convergence in the Frobenius norm of the
inverse PSD estimators to the true value, jointly across all frequencies, where
the number of frequencies are allowed to increase with sample size. This
results also yields a rate of convergence. We also empirically investigate
selection of the tuning parameters based on Bayesian information criterion, and
illustrate our approach using numerical examples utilizing both synthetic and
real data.

series. We would like to identify the dependency structure among these sensors

regularization parameter. Lastly, we consider that, the application of AR
models onto data usually requires detrending the raw data, however, this step
is forbidden in online context. Therefore, we augment the proposed AR models by
incorporating trend as extra parameter, and then adapt the online algorithms to
the augmented data models, which allow us to simultaneously learn the graph and
trend from streaming samples. In this work, we consider primarily the periodic
trend. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data are performed,

question imagine extending a dataset of handwritten digits MNIST by sampling
additional images until they start repeating. We call the collection of all
resulting images of digit 3 the ""full set."" To study the properties of the full
set we introduce a tensor network architecture which simultaneously
accomplishes both classification (discrimination) and sampling tasks.
Qualitatively, our trained network represents the indicator function of the
full set. It therefore can be used to characterize the data itself. We
illustrate that by studying the full sets associated with the digits of MNIST.
  Using quantum mechanical interpretation of our network we characterize the
full set by calculating its entanglement entropy. We also study its geometric
properties such as mean Hamming distance, effective dimension, and size. The
latter answers the question above -- the total number of black and white threes
written MNIST style is $2^{72}$.

problems by applying the Pontryagin maximum principle and then solving for a
Hamiltonian dynamical system. Applying the Pontryagin maximum principle to the
original optimal control problem shifts the learning focus to reduced
Hamiltonian dynamics and corresponding adjoint variables. Then, the reduced
Hamiltonian networks can be learned by going backwards in time and then
minimizing loss function deduced from the Pontryagin maximum principle's
conditions. The learning process is further improved by progressively learning
a posterior distribution of the reduced Hamiltonians. This is achieved through
utilizing a variational autoencoder which leads to more effective path
exploration process. We apply our learning frameworks called NeuralPMP to
various control tasks and obtain competitive results.
